EPISTEMOLOGY OF THE CLOSET.

By Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. University of California Press. 258pp. $24.95.

On the subject of sexual oppression-as on a number of other things-Gore Vidal is difficult to refute. Compressed into a few urbane sentences, his view goes like this: "There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices, and what anyone does with a willing partner is of no social or cosmic significance." Reasonable enough. But despite the Freudian Revolution, the Aquarian Age and the existence today of surpassingly sane views like Vidal's, erotic life, for many, remains fraught with guilt and fear.

It has been said that in the twentieth century an erotic life is the closest thing many of us have to what in times past was called a spiritual life. And where there's a spiritual life there are likely to be commandments, transgressions, guilt and penance. One feels the need for priests. The possibility exists, in fact, that the so-called sexual revolution of the twentieth century may have been a rather repressive cultural event. If the black-robed priest with his holy icons has, for much of the educated middle class, taken a step back into the shadows, he has often been succeeded by the genial therapist commending faith in the blessed trinity of good health, steady earnings and good (heterosexual) sex.

This movement from the policing of the religious spirit to the (far subtler) policing of desire began even before Freud and the culture of normative psychoanalysis. It seems that the Victorians, whom we tend to imagine as button-lipped on the subject of sex, actually could talk about little else, providing that the talk went on in the jargon of scientific high seriousness. The drive behind the newly burgeoning scientia sexualis was to describe and codify sexual life, to create multivolume encyclopedias of human sexuality that would exhaust the topic. Anything but an age of simple repression, the Victorian period was, we are now told, loud with erudite babble on the subject of sex.

But the Victorian subject of sex was not, to get back to Vidal's distinction, primarily a science of acts. It was a science of persons. That is, the assumption began to take hold that a person's essential identity was established by his or her sexual preferences. Thus came the genesis of an astounding number of sexual character types: the pedohil the fetishist, the hysterical woman, the repressed man. A miser was someone who had never quite left the anal-erotic stage; the compulsive talker was locked in an impossible romance with her mother's breast. Suddenly you were, in some inescapable and essential way, what you did in bed or on the floor, or-a sophisticated step later-what you had done in excess or not enough as a child. At the center of this vast botany of human types was the key and commanding distinction: One was either homosexual or heterosexual, gay or straight.

Homosexuality, says Michel Foucault, whose thinking I have been paraphrasing here, was invented in 1870. To put it less dramatically, one might say that people around that time began talking less about same-sex erotic acts and more about homosexual persons. To Foucault, the invention of homosexuality contributed vastly to the designs of something that he, with a Parisian weakness for darkly imposing God-replacements, calls Power. Power achieves its goals-conformity and productivity-by conferring, enforcing and manipulating identities. The coherent inner self, which was to Kant and many of his Enlightenment compeers the source of freedom, is to Foucault a function of Power. The more stable a selfhood you have, the more it's conferred on you by the reigning normative sciences, the easier you are to know and thus to control.

Foucault's reflections on the disciplined subject are the takeoff point for Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's Epistemology of the Closet. But Sedgwick puts a very fresh and canny twist on Foucault. Disciplinary society (our society, as Foucault and Sedgwick conceive it) doesn't confer clear identities-gay or straight, depraved or righteous-so much as it systematically blurs the boundaries between the terms, thus leaving everybody, and most painfully gay men, in a state of anxious uncertainty. That uncertainty is much more manipulable, Sedgwick argues, than any monolithic identity could possibly be. The "discourse" of modern sexuality keeps everybody off balance.

One of Sedgwick's strengths-one of many-is that she can show this uncertainty to be in effect not just in influential literary works of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (she offers readings of Melville, Wilde, Nietzsche, James and Proust, among others) but also, with horrible effect, in the contemporary political and legal spheres. Despite all of the talk current now about "engaged" or "activist" literary criticism, no book I have recently read is as successful as Sedgwick's in making provocative connections between literary acts and social dynamics.

What, exactly, is this system of imposed uncertainty that makes Vidal's paradise of sexual acts, from Sedgwick's point of view at least, currently untenable? Sedgwick sees contemporary American culture as sustaining a pair of mutually exclusive definitions of gay male identity (the degree to which this is applicable to lesbians is left open). These she calls the "universalizing" and the "minoritizing" views. The universalizing view (Vidal's view, more or less) holds that there is no such thing as a stable erotic identity: Everyone is, at least to some degree, bisexual in disposition if not in actual behavior. The minoritizing view maintains that there are persons who are, essentially and unalterably, gay. Most of us, Sedgwick thinks, hold both of these views simultaneously, despite the fact that they comprise what she calls "irreducible incoherence:' What interests Sedgwick isn't the epistemological oddity of the situation but its social effects.

Take, for example, what Sedgwick identifies as a current legal defense for violence against gay men, the "homosexual panic" defense. The homosexual panic defense maintains that there exists a certain distinct minority of men who become so threatened by a homosexual advance that they panic, enter a psychotic phase and can't be held fully responsible for their violent (re)actions. And those actions are carried out against another recognizable minority, people who are intrinsically, essentially gay. But the efficiency of the defense relies on establishing a feeling of kinship between jurors and defendants. Yes:' the juror is supposed to think, "that's the way I could have acted. Wouldn't anyone be likely to do the same? "

The defense plays on the incoherence between minoritizing and universalizing conceptions of sexual identity. Gaybashing:' the juror may suppose, "is something only latent homosexuals do: Those people are sick and deserve judicial mercy!' But also (secretly), "That's something I might do: Let's let them off easy." Of course, that thinking sets up scenarios in which anyone ("because we're all a little bit gay") can be identified by another as a homosexual ("someone who's really gay") making an advance, and be assaulted as a consequence. This incoherence leaves everyone, at times, open to blackmail, open to violence, a victim of Foucault's discipline.

Sedgwick argues that sexual double S binds have been the way of the Western world since at least the latter part of the nineteenth century. John Claggart, the homosexual villain in Melville's Billy Budd, is portrayed as being both part of a small and reprehensible minority and a partial reflection of the reader and everyone else in the novella, a universal ingredient in male selfhood. Claggart's confusion (is he natural or unnatural, innocent or corrupt?) isn't, accordingly, limited to him: It is a confusion that the men oh the warship Bellipotent, all of whose desires are same-sex desires, and the reader, too, are compelled to share.

In a remarkable critical move, Sedgwick goes on to connect the epistemological confusion about sexual identity with the novel's political plot. Mutiny is in the offing, and just as anyone can be homosexual-and one can be gay oneself and not know-anyone is, potentially, a mutineer. The vigilance to discern "sexual deviation" plays reciprocally with a vigilance to ferret out (or to create for the purposes of example) the lineaments of treason.

This sort of double bind, in which one is caught between extremes, wondering at others and at oneself, and wondering at the shape of others' wondering at oneself in macabre mirror games, is, Sedgwick believes, representative of the effectively coercive illogic of our culture. In fact, she argues that many of the impossible double binds in which we find ourselves can, and ought to be, explicated by recourse to the tensions between gay and straight, between minoritizing and universalizing accounts of sexuality. We ought, Sedgwick feels, to use her reflections on sexual epistemology to look into such cultural dualisms as private and public, masculine and feminine, innocence and initiation, natural and artificial, the better to see how the incoherences within these oppositions make us the prey of discipline. Is Sedgwick right? Should we follow her lead?

Surely there are reasons to consider doing so. Epistemology of the Closet is a remarkable work of mind and spirit. The literary analyses are excellent: The Melville chapter, the brilliant complexity of which my description barely touches, is one of the best critical essays I have read in the past five years. Though the book is cast in a densely academic idiom, it manages to be surprising, moving and witty. At its best, Sedgwick's style is both intimate and forcefully analytical. One must add, though, that at her infrequent worst she commits some astoundingly bad sentences: Abstractions pile into each other as though an intellectual demolition derby were in progress. And too, the structure of Epistemology of the Closet is disappointing: Some of the later chapters seem to precede, conceptually, those encountered earlier, such that the work lacks a drama of unfolding thought. But whatever faults of protocol the book may have, they are virtually eclipsed by its scruple, its intellectual rigor (the book is academic in the best sense of the word), its humane honesty and, most important, by its stunningly high standard of intelligence.

Yet, I wonder about Sedgwick's central premise. Do we all, as she claims, hold minoritizing and universalizing views of sexual identity in dangerous suspension, making ourselves and others prey to a cruel incoherence? Sedgwick, I think, is a touch misleading when she uses the term "universalizing" to describe one take on sexual identity. "Universalizing" sounds bad; it associates the perspective with those oppressive metaphysical systems from which many intellectuals are trying to distance themselves. But what Sedgwick calls a universalizing view is actually one holding that accident, luck, personal choice, environment and a variety of other factors contribute to making our erotic selves what they are. The view confirms as well that those erotic selves will change: They are the product and the future prey of, among other things, time and chance. Under such an understanding, our relationship to erotic life would be comparable in many ways (though not all) to our relationship to the vocation that we've both chosen and been chosen by. I'm not sure, that is, that this sort of understanding, one that affirms the contingency of erotic choice and starts out from the working hypothesis that everyone is, at least potentially, bisexual in disposition, isn't rather commonplace in the present, both among gay people and straight. And if this view (which ought to be called a contingent, not a universalizing, one) is at least sometimes in effect, the sorts of binds that Sedgwick is so brilliant at explicating are not the exclusive order of our cultural moment.

Perhaps it's not accidental that the texts Sedgwick uses to illustrate the double bind come from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and from some of the more benighted moments in contemporary litigation. Would matters be the same if for Melville and Company the book substituted contemporary gay and lesbian writers like Allen Ginsberg, Rita Mae Brown, Edmund White and Adrienne Rich?

Maybe so. But my view-and it is a view, I should admit, derived from far less intense and lengthy reflection than Sedgwick's-is that Sedgwick is right for some people and situations but not for all. Though we haven't yet reached the desirable state that Vidal describes, in which sex acts lose their social and cosmic (though not, one hopes, their personal) resonance, it's also doubtful that in the culture of the present every gay person is caught in an endlessly revolving closet door.
