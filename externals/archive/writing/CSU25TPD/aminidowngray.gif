If that happens, it replaces the remote error message with a more "friendly" description of the error, which obscures the server's error message. Historically, this is because Apache's and IIS's error messages are famously non-helpful, and were less than that minimum size. This unnecessarily verbose comment serves only to cause this page (whose status code may be a 404, set in toolbar.py:GET_s) to go over that minimum size, so that we can force our content to be shown to IE users with "friendly error messages", even on braindead browsers. --></html>
