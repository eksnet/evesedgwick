When I was asked to supply this "recommended reading" list, it was requested that I concentrate on poetry. Poetry figures significantly here, but I'm hesistant to perpetuate that myth that only other poets read poetry, and that they read nothing else. We're close to New Yorker cartoonland there. I'd rather give a more accurate picture of my reading and hope that other contributors to The Nation's holiday lists have included some of the exceptional new poetry around amidst their other choices.

Probably the book of any genre that's impressed and moved me most in the past twelve months is Hayden Carruth's magisterial Collected Shorter Poems, 1946-1991 (Coppeer Canyon, $28; Paper $14). It's too big a book to read in a week or a month: big in scope as well as heft. Carruth is an unacknowledged titan of contemporary letters: The quirky and unique historical and political intelligence at work here, along with a deceptively effortless-seeming prosodic virtuosity and Carruth's perfect pitch for a certain American idiom, make this book a continuing relevation. Carruth's collection of essays, Suicides and Jazzers (University of Michigan, $34.50; Paper $12.95), is an all-night convservation with a guy who talks amazing shop on a variety of subjects: Bix Beiderbecke, Paul Goodman, a New England boyhood and, yes, suicide.

I've just finished Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's brilliant essay collection Tendencies (Duke University, $44.95; Paper $15.95). Sedgwick is one of the smartest and wittiest critics writing. The play of her mind as it goes from Henry James to John Waters and Divine, from AIDS to Jane Austen to women's anal eroticism, is dazzling. (She promises that Mme. de Sevigne and Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book will figure in studies to come; only she could find a way to link the two.) Her work is often as moving as it is acute: Like the best of the gay male writers whose work has been her principal subject, in her prose flawless surface lures the reader to explore new depths.

A new and necessary complement to Sedgwick's work in queer theory is Terry Castle's The Apparitional Lesbian (Columbia Universityh, $29.95). Informed by Sedgwickhs theories but seeing their cultural Weltanschauung as at least diminished by the exclusioni of female homosocial and homosexual relationships, Castle examines the lesbian "absence" in locations where her presence might seem inevitable (an analysis of Diderot's la Religieuse, for example) and restores her centrality in examinations of a novel by Sylvia Townsend Warner, in the exuberant life of Janet Flanner, in Henry James's cautionary The Bostonians, in lesbian diva-dienst for mezzos in trouser roles. Castle's prose is deceptively direct and lucid: an antidote to deconstructive semantic excess while nonetheless employing deconstructive strategies.

Yusef Komunyakaa is a poet whose work, over ten years and many books, continues to grow in complexity and beauty. His selected poems, Neon Vernacular (Wesleyan University, $30; Paper $14.95), includes (from his earlier Dien Cai Dau) some of the best Vietnam testimony, in verse or prose, that I've ever read. Komunyakaa's whole oeuvre explores and re/members the double consciousness at work in the construction and preservation of African-American male identity. But it's the lush specifics, the trumpet-solo narratives (Komunyakaa, like Carruth, or perhaps unlike him in crucial ways, is a jazz buff), that make this writer memorable. Magic City, his new collection, also from Wesleyan $22.50; Paper $10.95), depicts a Louisiana bayou boyhood and the generations that preceded it, with lyricism, humor, rage and a delicate balance between heard and heightened language.

Finally, this is a fine occasion to cheer the appearance of the new edition of No More Masks! (HarperCollins, Paper $15). Florence Howe has radically revised and expanded the germinal anthology of twentieth-century American (U.S., that is) women poets she and Ellen Bass first edited in 1973. That edition made nonpolemical discussion of contemporary women's poetry academically and critically legitimate (much as William Carlos Williams legitimized the discussion of American poetry fifty years earlier). And that first anthology was itself one of the reasons there is such added scope in the second, not only in the inclusion of younger poets like Olga Broumas, Cheryl Clarke, Marilyn Nelson Waniek and Jorie Graham but in the addition of Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Angelina Weld Grimke and Lorine Niedecker, as well as very-much-alive older poets like Josephine Jacobsen and Marie Ponsot. Significantly, at least one older poet, Amy Clampitt, is a "younger poet" in terms of her book publication dates, though not in terms of her critical standing: The explosion of women's writing into readerly and critical consciousness, like the concurrent and overlapping surge of work by African-American writers of both sexes, has changed not only the process of canon formation but the myth of the writer's education, self-discovery and public recognition. No More Masks! was, in 1973, an introduction for many readers to the work of Muriel Rukeyser, of Carolyn Kizer, of H.D. The canon has not changed so much that these will not be discoveries for the 1993 edition's new readers. This is another book for frequent return trips--and a great gift for your daughter or your mother (even if she had the first edition).
