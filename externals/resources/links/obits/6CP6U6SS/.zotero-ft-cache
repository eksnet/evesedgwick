Remembering Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick by Jason Baumann, Collections Strategy/LGBT Collections, Stephen A. Schwarzman Building April 13, 2009

  esedgewick3.jpg Staff at the Library were deeply saddened today by news of the passing of pioneering scholar, and LGBT Committee Ambassador, Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick. Sedgwick's breakthrough studies, like  Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire and Epistemology  of the Closet,  transformed LGBT scholarship across the humanities. She taught us to read in a whole new way---not to read homosexuality as much as the productive power of its invisibility. She also radically widened the possibilities of scholarship with deeply personal, vulnerable, autobiographical thinking, like her essay "White Glasses." An entire generation of scholars are deeply in her debt.

I really like the fresh

Submitted by Maris Cooey on March 25, 2010 at 1:45 AM.

I really like the fresh perpective you did on the issue. Really was not expecting that when I started off studying. Your concepts were easy to understand that I wondered why I never looked at it before. Glad to know that there’s an individual out there that definitely understands what he’s discussing. Great job!
