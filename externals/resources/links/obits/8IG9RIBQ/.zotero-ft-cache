Writer and critic considered a founder of queer theory

The US academic and writer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who has died aged 58 of breast cancer, was one of the sharpest and most committed exponents of queer theory, the exploration of sexual perspectives other than that of conventional straightness in literature and the humanities. Though herself heterosexual, she was fascinated by the complex nature of relationships and desire, declaring herself proud of "having a life where work and love are impossible to tell apart".

Queer theory rejects labels such as gay and straight, referring instead to a sense of identity that subverts presumed norms and social codes. Sedgwick and her colleagues recognised social perceptions of sexuality as worthy of contemplation, drawing inspiration from the French philosopher Michel Foucault, and with roots in both the gay and lesbian studies of the 1980s and traditional literary academia. To Sedgwick, "queer" was "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's sexuality aren't made (or can't be made) to signify monolithically".

Her first book, Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (1985), explored male bonds in 19th-century novels, considering authors such as Dickens and the "erotic triangles" of homosexual, homosocial and homophobic relations depicted. She later produced a lesbian reading of Jane Austen, which was received with horror by rightwing commentators, who were appalled at the notion that homosexuality could be taught on a mainstream curriculum alongside Plato and Shakespeare. This inspired a typically witty retort from her pen: "Read any Sonnets lately? You dip into the Phaedrus often? To invoke the utopian bedroom scene of Chuck Berry's immortal aubade: Roll over, Beethoven, and tell Tchaikovsky the news."

Eve Kosofsky was born in Dayton, Ohio. Her family moved to Bethesda, Maryland, during her childhood, where her father took a position at Nasa as a lunar cartographer and her mother worked as a high-school teacher. She read English at Cornell University, New York state, before going on to Yale, Connecticut and completing her doctorate in 1975. She taught at Boston University (1981-83) and Amherst College, Massachusetts (1984-88), before spending a decade in the pioneering department of sexuality studies at Duke University, North Carolina, taken on by the literary theorist Stanley Fish, to bring a more progressive agenda.

In 1969 she married Hal Sedgwick, while she was at Cornell. Their first marital home was a commune. They then lived apart for many years and met up at weekends, as they pursued individual careers - he also worked as an academic, in optometry - but were eventually reunited later in life in New York, where she taught at the City University from 1998.

Sedgwick's ideas are perhaps best outlined in Epistemology of the Closet (1990), acknowledged by many, including her fellow pioneer in queer theory Judith Butler, as a founding text of the field. In Epistemology, Sedgwick uses Oscar Wilde, Henry James and Marcel Proust, to identify what is between gender and the increasing significance placed on normative sexual identities. As she states: "An understanding of virtually any aspect of modern western culture must be, not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance to the degree that it does not incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition."

And before the theory ended, her activism began. Colleagues from her era at Duke recall her passion for combating social injustices, which always began on a local level. Alongside the theorising of her seminal collection of essays, Tendencies (1993), she would present cold, hard facts, revealing the US government's suppression of gay teenage suicide rates or the censorship of HIV education. There was no need for shock tactics, as the reality was harsh enough: "I've heard of many people who claim they'd as soon their children were dead as gay. What it took me a long time to believe is that these people are saying no more than the truth," she wrote. Deaths were frequent as HIV gripped hold of the queer world around her.

After undergoing chemotherapy following her diagnosis of cancer in 1991, Sedgwick addressed her own fears about mortality, and feelings of gender identity post-mastectomy, producing A Dialogue of Love (1999), based on conversations in therapy. She shared advice drawn from her experiences of the illness in a column, Off My Chest, for a women's cancer magazine. Her other passions included writing poetry - she published an anthology, Fat Art, Thin Art (1995). She also produced visual art, and was a practising Buddhist.

She is survived by her husband Hal, mother Rita and siblings Nina and David.
