Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, 1950-2009

200px-Eve_Kosofsky_Sedgwick_by_David_Shankbone Duke University Press mourns the loss of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.

      We have been proud to publish six of Sedgwick’s books. The first, Tendencies (1992) is one of the founding texts in queer theory. Writing in the New York Times Book Review , Karla Jay said, “ Tendencies is a selection of Sedgwick’s brilliant and provocative essays. . . . The associations she makes are novel and imaginative.” Sedgwick then published Fat Art, Thin Art (1994), a book of poems; and edited Shame and Its Sisters: A Silvan Tompkins Reader ( 1995, with Adam Frank), Gary in Your Pocket (1996) and Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction (1997). Always on the cutting edge, more recently she has been leading the scholarship on affect with Touching, Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity (2003).

      More than just a Duke author, Sedgwick helped to define the Press as we went through major editorial changes in the 1990s. In 1992, along with Michèle Aina Barale, Michael Moon, and Jonathan Goldberg, she founded the influential Series Q, helping to found the discipline of queer theory. Under her guidance, Duke Press has become a leader in that field; Series Q now includes 42 books .
