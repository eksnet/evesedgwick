Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is survived by her husband Hal, whom she married in 1969. But she was not "straight." To her, nobody was. The concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality were mere constructs.

If Sedgwick did not exist, social conservatives might have had to invent her. After earning an English Ph.D. in the mid-1970s at Yale University, where "there wasn't even feminism, let alone gay and lesbian studies," she helped pioneer a contrarian and controversial new field that came to be called queer studies. Sexuality, she argued, existed on a continuum, so the "modern homo/heterosexual definition" was flawed; the works of Shakespeare and Tennyson and Dickens were rife with homoeroticism; literary works could not be understood without an assessment of their same-sex relationships.

"It's about trying to understand different kinds of sexual desire and how the culture defines them," she told The New York Times in 1998. "It's about how you can't understand relations between men and women unless you understand the relationship between people of the same gender, including the possibility of a sexual relationship between them."

Sedgwick, raised by a liberal family in Maryland, worked as a professor at several universities in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1989, she drew widespread scorn.

As a professor at Duke University, which hired her the year prior as part of an effort to transform its moribund English department into a bastion of cutting-edge thought, she produced a paper called "Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl." Time called her a "nutty professor;" Lynne Cheney, wife of Dick and head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, cited her in a panicked report.

To her detractors, Sedgwick was everything wrong with the late-20th century academy: relativist, revisionist, radical.

Undeterred, she set about completing the provocative works for which she would become best known: Epistemology of the Closet , the most famous, in 1990; Tendencies in 1993; and Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction in 1997. Among the essays in Tendencies : "How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay" and "Is the Rectum Straight?"

Sedgwick was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991.

In her 1999 A Dialogue on Love , she analyzes her feelings about the recurring illness, for which she underwent chemotherapy and a mastectomy, through the prism of conversations with her therapist.

The cancer claimed her Sunday. She was 58.
