Remembering Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick
By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Duke University, 1997 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick

Tributes to the literary scholar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who died on Sunday at age 58, have been trickling onto the blogosphere. (Click here , here and, for The Times’s obituary, here .)

Sedgwick, a key figure in the development of queer theory , wasn’t a household name, unless you count the brouhaha over her 1989 essay “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl,” which featured in many of the ritualistic first-kill-all-the-professors stories from our long culture war. (For literary theorists, becoming a household name is usually about as much fun as being attacked by killer bees.)

But Sedgwick’s books, including “Between Men” and “Epistemology of the Closet,” were on the shelves of most of the graduate students and comp-lit survivors, gay and straight (a neat division rejected by Sedgwick, who was married to a man), that I knew back in the 1990s. I remember reading her essay collection “Tendencies” (click here for Karla Jay’s assessment in the Book Review) while serving on a jury in a rape trial — talk about a collision of incompatible discourses of sexuality!

Sedgwick’s radical challenge to heteronormative ways of reading and living may seem quaint (if that’s the word) in a time when people are celebrating same-sex weddings in Iowa and the White House Easter egg hunt conspicuously includes gay and lesbian families. But perhaps the future evoked in Jay’s review of “Tendencies” — one where Sedgwick would be photographed shaving fellow queer-studies scholar Terry Castle on the cover of Time magazine, à la Cindy Crawford and K. D. Lang — isn’t quite here.

(Postscript: Sedgwick was also a poet. Her collection “Fat Art, Thin Art” was published by Duke University Press in 1994.)

    Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. I met her, worked with and for her, and learned from her, in the depths of an epidemic of homophobia, ignorance, and loss.

    Beloved person.

    A scholar, a healer, a weaver, a soul.

    Though I never knew her, I feel like I’ve lost a friend. In many ways, she taught me how to read.

    I met Eve as a freshman at Cornell, when she was only 17. For years I couldn’t quite reconcile myself to her career as a theorist, because she was the most talented young poet I ever saw. We were sporadically in touch throughout the years. I am only writing to say that I am heartbroken in a way I cannot really explain or understand. I have wanted the Net to be flooded with tributes from people who knew her better and understood her better than I did. But it isn’t, so here’s mine. It hurts that you’re no longer in the world, Eve.

    I was fascinated to see in her obit that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick was Cornell Class of l971, one year ahead of me. I looked and looked at her photo, trying to call up some memory of her in an English class, but I couldn’t dredge anything up. It would have been interesting to contemplate that an intellectual storm had been brewing in the brain of that girl next to me in that Milton seminar and I didn’t notice.

    The Cornell, English department tellingly the long-time home of M.H. Abrams of Norton Anthology fame, was quite theory-free in the years that Ms. Sedgwick, David Fried and I passed through it. To the extent that one could discern any overruling tendency, it seemed like we were living in the twilight of the New Criticism and old-fashioned Anglo-American roll-up-your-sleeves literary scholarship. But soon enough Jacques Derrida and Julie Kristeva started showing up as visiting lecturers, probably under the aegis of Jonathan Culler and certain troublemakers in the French department, and the Age of Deconstruction arrived in the Finger Lakes. E.B. White and Vladimir Nabokov wept; we’ll probably never know what Thomas Pynchon thought. Go, Big Red.

    I, too, mourn the loss of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick , though I never knew her and never knew she went to Cornell, as I did. I also made a brief stop at Hamilton, but I missed her by not many years at each school. She was formative in my growth as a feminist/queer reader/critic. To see her speak was to see brilliance nearly physically exude from her person. My deep sympathy goes to her family and to her many friends inside and outside the academy. What a legacy she leaves.
