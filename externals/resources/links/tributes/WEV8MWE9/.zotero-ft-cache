kthread spins: in memory of eve kosofsky sedgwick

    Podcast

To my way of thinking, all podcasts in memory of someone should inspire dancing and, possibly, a wake.

Earlier this month, gender theorist Eve Sedgwick died; her last book, Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity (2003) influences the way I think about collective action through online networks.

Those familiar with her work will understand the selections; would that I could listen to this with my brilliant friend Ben, perhaps at Michael’s Bistro in Charlottesville, as he locates invitations and meaning from her theories and others as nimbly as he forms arguments employing the work. I do think an event with bourbon, critical inquiry, and all the theory geeks I used to drink with is in order the next time I pass through Virginia (Sean B., your presence is required).

I’m listening closely to the background of “Mrs. Love” (recognize that band?) and especially grateful to all of you for sending and pointing me toward specific musicians lately—this is for you too.

Sad to know that Eve passed away. The book that touched me the most was “A dialogue on love” because elements in her book reflected to myself. Nice of you to remember a great writer, this way.
