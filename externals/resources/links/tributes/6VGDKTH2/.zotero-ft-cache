Cool, queer white glasses

I feel queer and really deeply saddened on hearing the news of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's death . The prospect of no longer having the chance to even hope for the next chapter in our ongoing email exchange is devastating. As I am prompted to write the briefest of memorials, I would like to offer a rephrasing of the opening line of Sedgwick's essay White Glasses, to pay homage to the critical space that she opened up for thinking "across genders, across sexualities":

    The first time I met [Michael Lynch] Eve Sedgwick, I thought his white-framed glasses were the coolest thing I had ever seen.

The first time I met Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick was in London, in early November 2007, at a workshop on theories of performativity. And there they were, those white glasses, just as queer as I had imagined them, the marker of Sedgwick's identification with the gay academic, activist and friend Michael Lynch , with whom – she had declared in the essay – she shared a passion for lesbian literary icons, a commitment to Aids activism and a vision for queer studies.

The white glasses indicated to me Sedgwick's steadfast personal commitment to, and intellectual investment in, thinking queerly across a range of disciplinary and other boundaries, and against the strictures of received classifications. As Sedgwick has taught us, "queer is a continuing moment, movement, motive – recurrent, eddying, troublant. The word 'queer' itself means across". To think (or read) queerly, then, is to think/read across genders, across sexualities, across genres, across "perversions". As Sedgwick explains in Tendencies (1998), "queer" is therefore "multiply transitive", as antiseparatist as it is antiassimilationist, "keenly, it is relational, and strange".

In Epistemology of the Closet , for example, Sedgwick proposes that modern understandings of western homosexuality may be founded on assumptions about inversion and gender transitivity – making queer people appear to be peculiarly located between genders – and gender separatism – as in notions of "same-sex" desire – that naturalised and stabilised a binary gender model. These contradictory injunctions about sexuality, understood in the broader context of national and imperial relations, did not affect exclusively sexual minorities, but rather they impacted upon the wide range of subjects and knowledges within the western modern sexual formation.

Sedgwick's wide range of erudite and playful readings of literary and popular texts unpacked assumptions about the stability and coherence of sexual identity. The white-rimmed glasses were part of this critical project of envisioning social relations, affective attachments and knowledge practices that criss-cross genders and sexualities. Among the consequences of this careful disassembling of the conceptual apparatuses and discursive formations through which sexuality was framed was the realisation of queer theory's critical thrust, in the emergence of a range of different alignments that we live, love and think by.

This briefest of interventions, then, is to remember the cross-identificatory queer critical passion of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's brilliant, scholarly, irreverent and undisciplined writings and her queer white glasses, to imagine and invoke the possibility of an aptly discontinuous conversation across yet another threshold, that is, across what she called "the ontological crack between the living and the dead".

I offer my sincere condolences to Eve's husband, Hal Sedgwick, and her family and friends.
