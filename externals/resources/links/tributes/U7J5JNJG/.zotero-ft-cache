epistemology of the theorist
2

April 14, 2009 by Alex Patchin McNeill

Sometimes you read something and it changes the course of your life forever. Whether it’s a text, or a poem, or a story, there are some things that just rock you to your core, and you emerge at the end of the page, altered, seeing the world from a whole new perspective.

During my junior year of college, I read Epistemology of the Closet in a class called the Politics of Sexuality. At that point in my life I was a firmly established lesbian but after reading that text, I had only just begun to grasp the possibilities of queerness . I don’t think that when I first read it—painstakingly, over the course of hours—I understood half of it. But what I did know was that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick was on to something and that her words were opening up to further exploration the idea that sexuality is not a binary system and that gender is not a binary fact.

Sedgwick posited that the very words we choose to construct and articulate our identities are both bringing those identities into being, and at the same time foreclosing those identities from the possibilities of change. For me, Eve Sedgwick is the author who first introduced me to the idea that language is intrinsically connected to the ways that we know ourselves and our sexuality, as well as to the prophetic and poetic realms language has to offer the study and analysis of sex.

The fact that I didn’t understand half of the words or concepts in that first reading of the Epistemology of the Closet only fueled my desire to delve deeper into the lexicon of sexuality and to immerse myself in queer theory, since I felt that there truths of the universe and existence were being revealed. It also helped challenge me into living a fuller sense of queerness, not so tightly restricted by what I thought being a lesbian meant I should be. It allowed me to let go of the woman balloon I didn’t have such a strong grip on anyway in order to find myself finally free to explore who it was I might become if I didn’t have a whole air-filled chamber of expectations about what a woman should be hovering above me.

Today I learned that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick died last night after a long history of breast cancer. She was only 58. And while I did not know her, and have studied and learned from many theorists since my first experience with her, I am mourning the loss of her. She taught us to think things that had never before been thought or said, and allowed us to explore new ways of being that were previously unarticulated. It is fitting that Sedgwick was a practicing Buddhist, since Buddhism is so much a philosophy of be-ing, because she called us into new ways of be-ing, of knowing, and of understanding our human experience. On a memorial blog post, one of Eve’s dear friends writes, “according to The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying — which Evie did a seminar on, at Duke — she will be in the Bardo of Becoming for 40 days after the cessation of respiration. According to her belief, thoughts and prayers of the living will steady her soul as she passes through the bardos to the next life. And there _will_ be a next life.” If so, then I offer up these thoughts to her. Until she returns, reincarnate, we will give her words second life.

Thank you, Eve.
