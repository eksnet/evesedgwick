Last week, at a meeting of my department's graduate admissions
committee, one of my colleagues was complaining about a particular
applicant whose personal statement focused on being diagnosed with
depression in the middle of college. "I hate it when they use depression
as an excuse," this colleague said. To which another one responded,
"Depression is no excuse! Excuse, hell - it's a prerequisite."</p>

<p>There is a lot to say and wonder about the relation between
depression, under its many definitions, and the kinds of work we do over
the decades as feminists, as intellectuals and activists, as
autobiographers, and as teachers. In the process of thinking about this
talk, I've found myself juxtaposing some of the scenes of these
activities, and some of their different languages, beginning maybe
unexpectedly with the scenes of pedagogy. Even when we are not in our
classrooms, after all, each of these roles involves us in multiple
positions within a densely innervated matrix of generational
transmissions. And if the reader of our first-person writing doesn't
have the immediacy of a face at our seminar table, we are all the
likelier to endow her in our minds with the deeper pedagogical intimacy
of our parent, our child, our mentors, our enemies, our past or future
or alternative selves.</p>

<p>When I connect this pedagogical relation to the issue of depression,
I have in mind the reflections of the American psychologist Silvan
Tomkins on the depressive <i>personality</i> in the educator. I am also
thinking of Melanie Klein's related, but far from identical, notion of
the depressive <i>position</i>. As far as I can tell, current popular
thought seems to understand depression in terms of a kind of chronic
natural gloominess, on the one hand, or alternatively as a completely
exogenous malady, from who knows where, that is liable to descend on its
unsuspecting host until heroically routed by medicine and positive
mental hygiene. I have to say this version sounds very alien to me, even
though it sometimes feels as though half of my conversation consists of
urging other people to take antidepressants or find a shrink - in fact
even though my little memoir, <i>A Dialogue on Love</i>, is an attempt
to trace the course of a psychotherapy that I undertook to deal with
longstanding depression.</p>

<p>Departing from these forms of common sense about depression, Silvan
Tomkins, to the contrary, discusses <i>depressiveness</i>, or the
depressive personality or script, as a durable feature of certain
people's way of being, a constitutive feature of their best aptitudes as
well as disabilities, regardless of whether or not, at a given moment in
life, they are experiencing depression. This makes much more sense to
me - gets me further not only with depression itself, but with thinking,
writing, and especially teaching. At some places in Tomkins, this
depressiveness seems like a widespread and rather generalized state; at
others, Tomkins gives it a specificity that itself seems quite
autobiographical. For Tomkins, the most notable feature of <i>the
depressive</i>, on emerging from childhood, is that he or she combines a
passion for relations of mimetic communion - ideally, two-way or mutual
mimesis, based on the sweetness and anxiety for the child of imitating
and being imitated by an intermittently attentive adult - with an intense
susceptibility to shame when such relations fail. This is a recipe both
for overachievement in general and for pedagogical intensity in
particular. Tomkins writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The depressive, like his parent before him, is not altogether a
comfortable person for others with whom he interacts. As a friend or
parent or lover or educator he is somewhat labile between his
affirmations of intimacy and his controlling, judging, and censuring of
the other. His warmth and genuine concern for the welfare of others
seduces them into an easy intimacy which may then be painfully ruptured
when the depressive . . . finds fault with the other. The other is now
too deeply committed and too impressed with the depressive's sincerity
to disregard the disappointment and censure from the other and is
thereby seduced further into attempting to make restitution, to atone,
and to please the other. When this is successful, the relationship is
now deepened, and future ruptures will become increasingly painful - both
to tolerate and to disregard. So is forged the depressive dyad in which
there is great reward punctuated by severe depression. The depressive
creates other depressives by repeating the relationship which created
his own character. The depressive exerts a great influence on the lives
of all he touches because he combines great reward with punishment,
which ultimately heightens the intensity of the affective rewards he
offers others. . . . The depressive is concerned not only with
impressing, with pleasing and exciting others through his own
excellence, but also that others should impress him, should please him,
and should excite him through their excellence. . . . (Tomkins 225)</p></blockquote>

<p>Tomkins makes explicit, moreover, that in these depressive dramas our
students are likely to oscillate between two roles. On the one hand they
can function for us as "substitute <i>parents</i> who are to be
impressed [and] excited" but whose "boredom, . . . censure, and . . .
turning away constitute an enduring threat and challenge." On the other
hand, as they stand in for <i>ourselves as children</i>, we in the role
of their parent will "censure [our] beloved children for their
ignorance" and "love and respect them for their efforts to meet [our]
highest expectations" (Tomkins 228-29, emphasis added). Or to recast the
teaching situation in terms of a psychoanalytic encounter: sometimes I
feel like my students' analyst; other times, floundering all too visibly
in my helplessness to evoke language from my seminar, I feel like a
patient being held out on by 20 psychoanalysts at once.</p>

<p>To move from Silvan Tomkins's account of the depressive [person] to
Melanie Klein's account of the depressive position is like moving from a
minoritizing to a universalizing discourse. If Tomkins's depressive is a
particular <i>kind</i> of individual who emerges from the contingency of
a particular history with the strengths and weaknesses of a particular
interpretive and performative strategy, Klein's depressive position, to
the contrary, is a developmental phase - a developmental achievement - that
is potentially available to everyone. Moreover, the depressive position
is a uniquely spacious rubric. Despite its name it encompasses, for
example, both the preconditions of severe depression and also the
resources for surviving, repairing, and moving far beyond that
depression.</p>

<p>For Klein, the depressive position is one of only two positions - two
modes of relationality - available to human creatures. And while the
depressive position marks a developmental achievement over its
alternative, the fragile paranoid/schizoid position, it is not a
permanent achievement but part of a fluid, back-and-forth process
between the two positions. What defines the paranoid/schizoid position,
in all its fragility, are three rather violent things: the ego's
inability to tolerate anxiety or ambivalence; its consequent strategy of
splitting both its objects and itself into fragments that can be seen as
exclusively good or bad; and its aggressive expulsion of intolerable
parts of itself onto - or in Klein's more graphic locution,
<i>into</i> - the person who is taken as an object. Klein writes that
these "bad parts of the self are meant not only to injure but also to
control and to take possession of the object" (Klein, 8); she calls this
mechanism "projective identification." Projective identification is
related to Freudian projection but is more uncannily intrusive: for
Freud, when I've projected my hostility onto you, I believe that you
dislike me; for Klein, when I've projected my hostility <i>into</i> you,
you <i>do</i> dislike me. Projective identification is thus a good way
of understanding, for example, the terrifying contagion of paranoid
modes of thought - and as we'll see, it certainly seems indispensable for
a lot of political analysis and group dynamics. But it's also a helpful
way of understanding things that can go so painfully wrong in the
classroom. For instance, a professor who's unable to tolerate or contain
the anxieties of competition may run a classroom in which all find
themselves unusually anxious about power or disempowerment. A
professor's disavowed issues about originality can turn into a maelstrom
of plagiarism anxieties that circulate in all directions. Or a professor
who is unable to provide a home to her own discomforts about sexuality
can accumulate a group of students whose learning process is clogged
with manipulative or resentful scenes of seduction. All this is not even
to mention the projective identifications that originate with our
students, who can be just as self-ignorant or as disruptively
charismatic as ourselves, if not more so. Again both in and beyond the
classroom many of us, I think, are familiar with situations where our
own or other people's preemptive need to disown feelings of racism,
misogyny, anti-Semitism, and so forth - feelings that almost inevitably
arise but are experienced as intolerable - is liable to propel circuits of
interpersonal accusation that are explosive with the very forms of
hatred that are under internal erasure.</p>

<p>Thus for Klein's infant or adult, the paranoid/schizoid
position - marked by hatred, envy, and anxiety - is a position of terrible
alertness to the dangers posed by the hateful and envious part-objects
that one defensively projects into the world around one. The depressive
position, by contrast, is an anxiety-mitigating achievement which the
infant or adult only sometimes, and often only briefly, succeeds in
inhabiting. What makes the depressive position "depressive"? The
threshold to the depressive position is the foundational, authentically
difficult understanding that good and bad tend to be inseparable at
every level. "The infant," as one Kleinian summarizes this argument, "at
some stage . . . is physically and emotionally mature enough to
integrate his or her fragmented perceptions, bringing together the
separately good and bad versions. . . . <i>When such part-objects are
brought together as a whole they threaten to form a contaminated,
damaged, or dead whole object</i>," whether internal, external, or
both - what I take to be a description of the experience of depression per
se (Hinshelwood 138, emphasis added).</p>

<p>"Depressive anxiety," this account continues, "is the crucial element
of mature relationships, the source of generous and altruistic feelings
that are devoted to the well-being of the object" (138). This, then, is
the position from which it is possible to begin using one's own
resources to assemble or "repair" the part-objects into something like a
whole, albeit a compromised one. Once assembled, these more realistic,
durable, and in that sense satisfying objects are available to be
identified with, to offer one and to be offered nourishment and comfort
in turn. Yet the pressures of that founding, depressive realization can
also continually impel the ego back toward depression, toward manic
escapism, or toward the violently projective defenses of the
paranoid/schizoid position. We feel these depressive pressures in the
forms of remorse, shame, confusion, depression itself, mourning for the
lost ideal, and - often most relevant - a sad understanding of the
inexorable laws of unintended consequences.</p>

<p>My own sense is that activist politics, even more than pedagogy,
takes place - even at best - just at this difficult nexus between the
paranoid/schizoid and the depressive positions. Suppose the
paranoid/schizoid, entirely caught up in splitting and projection, to be
always saying, like Harold Bloom or even George W. Bush, "Those others
are all about <i>ressentiment</i>." Suppose the depressive to be able to
say at least intermittently, "We, like those others, are subject to the
imperious dynamics of <i>ressentiment</i>; now how can the dynamics
themselves become different?" It would certainly be presumptuous for me
to suppose that the women represented here today all understand or do
activism in the same way, or at anything like the same depth, and I feel
out of my own depth in generalizing in this way. But as I understand my
own political history, it has often happened that the propulsive energy
of justification, of being or feeling joined with others in a right
cause, tends to be structured very much in a paranoid/schizoid fashion,
driven by attributed motives, fearful contempt of opponents, collective
fantasies of powerlessness and/or omnipotence, scapegoating, purism and
schism - paranoid/schizoid, in short, even as the motives that underlie
political commitment have much more to do with the complex, mature
ethical dimension of the depressive position.</p>

<p>What to make of the turn to life narrative in the context of such
split-natured and difficult activism and pedagogy? During the recent
political season I've been struck by one unabashedly paranoid/schizoid
kind of use of life narrative - as we've heard a phalanx of senators say
that while they may loathe the actions or principles of Alberto
Gonzales, for instance, it would be impossible to vote against <i>his
story</i>. And we've heard similar language about Condoleezza Rice's
"story" and Clarence Thomas's "story" and even John Edwards's "story,"
even if the latter of these did turn out to be possible to vote against.
A life story in this sense, <i>Gonzalez's story</i>, is less a narrative
than a compact consumer fetish, wholly instrumental, at once
inspirational and subtly accusatory, its own history effaced, perfectly
streamlined as a projectile to stop the mouths of his substantive
critics, and lodged in public consciousness as the insidiously potent
minimal unit of projective identification.</p>

<p>To the degree that our memoir writing aspires to be different from
this, it might make sense to think of it in relation to the depressive
position. Of course it's easy to fear that autobiography merely exposes
a bumptious narcissism, reeking with its primordial first person
singular. I'm much more struck by something else: the use of these
pages, if anything, to aerate, expose, and ideally to disable or "burn
out" the potency of certain violent defenses. At least, that ambition is
central to the way <i>A Dialogue on Love</i> is constructed. For me, the
interest of narrating this psychotherapy lies hardly at all in
reconstructing childhood material, as it happens - or even adult motives.
In fact, already, when I reread it, the accounts of myself seem
dangerously skill-less and unliving. Instead, what I wanted to make
palpable - and available - was the quality of a specific listening space, a
space that is open to every anxiety but resists propelling onward its
fatal itinerary. It fascinated me that my shrink, Shannon, was both a
particular kind of a person, "mild and bristling with his soft gray
nap,</p>
	
<blockquote><p><i>big-faced, cherubic,<br>
barrel chest, long arms, short legs,<br>
Rumpelstiltskin-like"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>- both that particular, grotesque and slightly fatuous middle-aged male
figure in a North Carolina landscape; and at the same time, someone
whose most economical means - a silence, an impassive face, a willing
inclination of the head - evoke a voice that never otherwise comes into
being, a voice that's somewhere between talking to oneself and another.
"When I'm away from Shannon," I write, "I try to summon it up - the voice
that speaks in a quiet double way, the being alone but not being
alone.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It is my own soft<br>
voice. But once I can hear it -<br>
I'm back with Shannon."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I think it's clear that a pedagogical desire underlies this
narrative - desire both to inhabit but equally to <i>offer</i> this
radically, ever newly unpreempted space. I wanted it in the formal
choices I made - the interpenetration of prose with chains of haiku, for
instance, as in the 17th-century Japanese form called <i>haibun</i>.
Also the interspersing of my accounts with passages in small capital
type from Shannon's notes - which record sometimes his thoughts but mostly
my thoughts and dreams, in a permeable first person that refers
sometimes to him and at other times to me. There are times when even I
can't tell whose first person it is.</p>

<p>In fact, as I find, it's my pedagogical impulse itself that draws me
into this space: not the desire to teach my shrink, though that's one
kind of (often intrusive) presence, but the fresh wellspring of my
identification with - and my mimicry of - <i>his</i> mysterious skill in
non-interference.</p>

<p>The strangest thing about this therapy, about the book's ambition, is
this: while it's directly about depression and depressiveness - and its
narrative encompasses illness, as well, in the period when I discovered
that my breast cancer had become metastatic and hence incurable - its
tonality, at least in my head, is something much more like comic. I
don't mean at all in the sense of gallows humor. It's more like the
comedy of underdetermination, of sudden relaxation. May I bring in yet
another linguistic framework, on top of Tomkins and Klein? It's about
karma. Not karma as a system of reward and punishment, but karma as
plain causality: the inexorable Rube Goldberg physics of those
uncontrollable chains of projective identification. The ways in which
what one <i>is</i> puts its fatal spin on what one says, does, and
perceives - and vice versa. For <i>ressentiment</i>, then, read karma - the
big messy psychic footprint, the things that make someone difficult to
be with or difficult to be. I'm imagining something like this, that the
paranoid/schizoid position involves bad karma, lots of it - it emerges
from bad karma and, through projective identification, sends more bad
karma careening out into the world. And the depressive position involves
the endless, heroic but discouraging attempt to turn bad karma into good
karma.</p>

<p>In every religious tradition I know of, though, there is at least one
stream that is heading somewhere different from this. In Buddhism you
could paraphrase it thusly: It's better to have good karma than bad
karma; but the best thing of all, the most liberating and skillful
thing, is to have no karma.</p>

<p>I should probably add that, at least in mystical Buddhism, no karma
doesn't mean no action. Instead, it's the figure without karma, the
bodhisattva, who is able to perceive and <i>be</i> perceived clearly
enough that the things they do are efficacious - and no more than
efficacious.</p>

<p>It seems inevitable that, for us karmic individuals, even the
invocation of non-karmic possibility will be karmically overdetermined:
it will have all too many uses, too many causes and too many effects.
Clearly it can function as evasion, the way the notion of the Aesthetic
is now seen as functioning. You might even see it as overdetermined by
our depressiveness itself and by our pedagogical neediness. At any rate,
that these elements can be closely proximate is clear. To me, though,
apparently a vision of non-karmic possibility, however subject to abuse,
at least opens a window to give air and light onto scenes of depressive
pedagogy.</p>

<p>At first I thought I'd know when therapy was successful because I'd
stop feeling the want of being dead.</p>

<p>But, I finally say to Shannon, "This is such a deep, old fact about
me that it could be a <i>terrible</i> index of what might change. If I
waited for that . . . !"</p>

<p>I'm wondering now what else might be different and better - even for
someone who remains convinced, with the ancients, that it would be best
not to be born.</p>

<p>Yes, Shannon says. He too has assumed this is a likely scenario: many
other things changing but the one thing not changing. Also, he says, if
such a thing did change it would probably do so imperceptibly slowly.</p>

<p>Then he produces an apparent non sequitur. A story about a patient of
his long ago, someone with "not exactly multiple personalities,</p>

<blockquote><p><i>but I would say that<br>the parts of her were only<br>barely holding
hands,"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>who after many years - in fact long after the end of therapy - woke up
one morning and found she no longer had multiples. Just that suddenly.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think he's produced this story "just in case." Just
in case, that is, what my announcement really meant was something
different, something like "I think I'm ready to relinquish this stubborn
symptom, but I'm scared about what will be left of <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>I love his floating the story so coolly <i>as</i> a non sequitur - a story
about the non-necessity, in therapy, of what "follows." It gives me a
clue. I want to be open to the chance that what any clamorous pain</p>

<blockquote><p><i>wants to tell me, is<br> 
	that it is ready at last<br>
	to bid me goodbye.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After this, in fact, I get very charmed and relaxed by everything
that looks like non-necessity. I've started noticing how lots of
Shannon's best comments - the ones that change the aspect of things for
me - amount to nothing more profound than "It ain't necessarily so."</p>

<p>Nowadays, when students ask me, about one thing or another, "But
wouldn't that clearly imply-?" or "Doesn't that have to involve-?", it
feels Shannonlike when I can respond,</p>

<blockquote><p><i>that may not be a<br>
theoretical question.<br>
Just empirical.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Here's a Buddhist meditation I've read about. I can even do it. </p><p>

</p><p>It happens in a public place; the substance of it is to recognize
that every other person there, one by one, male and female and young and
old, has been, in some earlier life, your mother.</p>

<p>Or more likely, in many lives.</p>

<p>And regarding the people one by one, you learn to understand how this
could have been so. One by one as you gaze, you can see what kind of
mother they were to you; you can see as well, slowly, what kind of a
child you were to them.</p>

<p>Over and over and over</p>

<blockquote><p><i>you're like Aeneas<br>
	encountering a stranger,<br> 
	Venus, and guessing,<br>
	just from the rosy<br>
	glow of their neck and their feet<br>
	and the stately step,<br>
	though too late, "Surely,<br>
	stranger, you are a goddess.<br>
	Surely, my mother."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Shy as I am, I'm pretty good at this meditation.</p>

<p>In almost every face I can find the curve of a tenderness, however
hidden. The place of a smile or an intelligence - a shared one.</p>

<p>Even in a skinhead without any lips to speak of; or in a girl who's
anxious, anorexic, half crazed with all her narcissistic burden - even
from her I can elicit and nurture it, the sense of her possible,
beautiful care of me. Indeed, of a compassion; of her imagination, or
his.</p>

<p>Of course, with babies it's easy.</p>

<p>In a roomful of my students - I can find it.</p>


<p>It's a therapy day and I've driven up to the gray building early for
our hour. Early enough to clamber across the parking lot, across the
parking lot of the bank next door, across Ninth Street, to ask someone
at the BP station on the corner a question about my car.</p>

<p>But the shrubby border between the two parking lots is unexpectedly
steep, mulched with its slippery pine needles. Typically clumsy, I
tumble, almost fall. Then collecting myself, move on</p>

<blockquote><p><i>through the bank's parking<br>
lot with all a fat woman's<br>
disavowing haste.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After my errand, I'm walking back from the gas station when I notice
Shannon rounding the corner toward the gray building. He's crossing the
bank parking lot ahead of me and doesn't see me.</p>

<p>When my sister and I were in the same high school, she bitterly
accused me of embarrassing her by walking around alone looking as if I
was <i>thinking</i>. I don't know if that's how Shannon looks; I notice
more the calm buoyancy with which he is able to steer his round, large,
light body, like a float in a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.</p>

<p>Even if he is thinking, he's alert to his surroundings. When he gets
near the bottom of the shrubby border, suddenly the balloon makes a
graceful, low dip: I see him gather up from the pavement the clumps of
pine mulch I kicked down as I was teetering on the brink. Then bobbing
up gently, he pats it back into place, his hands briefly smoothing it in
with the other mulch.</p>

<blockquote><p>Me hanging back, wanting not to be seen.</p>

<p><i>This little, spied-on<br>
scene: how does it endow me<br>
with hidden treasure?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Why do I feel afterwards as if, whatever my frustration or fear, I'm
carrying with me an object of reflection: if I turn inward toward it, it
will make me smile?</p>

<p>I'm wary of such sudden condensations of sweetness, the kind that, in
the past, have made me fall in love.</p>

<p>But I don't resist, either, secretly fingering this enigmatic pebble.
I can't quite figure out what makes its meaning for me.</p>

<p>Diffident, I write to my friend Tim that there may be something
inexhaustibly pleasing in the tight, light knot of space, time, and
seeing. How the small extent of Ninth Street, our wide-skied,
midwestern-feeling little college town, turns into a time-lapse graphic
that lets Shannon occupy the place where I was, encountering my ghost
without recognition, unmaking my mistake - me, turning back, seeing it.
And I love that his care for me was not care for <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>Tim writes back, "Far from tedious I find the image of Shannon
bending over to pick up mulch - the same that you had dislodged, in
falling, if I understood you - not knowing it was you who had dislodged
it, to have the power of something in De Quincey - or perhaps the film
noir version of De Quincey, that I carry around in my head.</p>
