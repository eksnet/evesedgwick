My Dear Holmes: Examining Eve
Sedgwick’s Theory of Homosociality in The Sign of 
Four
A very popular topic of Sherlockian study is the nature of the relationship between
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his companion Dr.
Watson: were they merely roommates? Friends? Lovers? For many present day theorists, this debate is complicated by historical cultural differences; that is to say, what might have been perfectly socially acceptable for two men in the 19
th
century may be considered
“queer” (double entendre intended) for men of today. Yet where do these notions of what is
acceptable heterosexual friendship originate? Why is there such a wealth of s tudy about  these two men, rather than other male figures? Why not women?
This article uses Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s theory of homosociality to e xamine the
relationship of Holmes and Watson in
The Sign of Four;
through this examination,
 
one easily can see the restrictions that Victorian society placed upon homosexual desires.
The Sign of Four 
is Arthur Conan Doyle’s second novel about Sherlock Holmes and
his friend Dr. Watson. Already established in Doyle
’s previous work,
 A Study in Scarl et,
as his roommate, Watson continues to assist Holmes in his criminal cases, serving primarily as a springboard, companion, and biographer. At the time of the novel, the two men have lived together for a number of months,
and have grown accustomed to each other’s personal
habits (to be discussed later). In the case in question, a young woman calls upon Holm es to
investigate mysterious circumstances surrounded her father’s disappearance, a nd her
anonymous receipt of pearls
through the mail. Holmes takes the case, and by the novel’s
conclusion, Watson and she are engaged to married. Yet this engagement seems rushed,
forced, and somewhat disingenuous, despite Watson’s vehemently (perhaps too
 
Alcaro 3 vehemently) insentience that he loves her. It seems that there is a better explanation for his course of action- one that is directly influenced by S herlock Holmes. In her study
Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire,
Sedgwick  examines these deeply complicated relationships between male characters, most especially in English novels of the 19
th
century. She specifically looks at the structure of male relationships with other men: how they are set up, what the expectations of the relationship are, and what is assumed by either person about the relationship. (Sedgwick, 1685). However, in order to understand individual relationship between men, one must  first examine the context of the society in which they exist. Sedgwick points out that Western society as a whole is patriarchal: that is to say, it  is a system of power established by men, with the interests of men in mind. As such, much
of this society is built on the foundation of a “male dominated kinship system.” (Sedgwick,
1686). One of the unfortunate consequen ces of this system, however , is the fallacious logic
that men of such a system employ, which results in a cultural assumption of “obligatory heterosexuality” in which “homophobia is a necessary consequence.” (Sedgwick, 1686).
Many men who live in a patriarchic society are imbued from their youth with a
homophobic attitude that they assume is a necessary part of being “a man” in their culture.
Thus these men create from themselves an ironic sense of social oppression that is the direct result of the society that they themselves created; women, on the other hand, the ones who are typically constrained and limited by this male-dominated culture are ironically more free in their relationships with members of their own sex.
According to Sedgwick, “in a society where
men and women differ in their access to power, there will be important gender differences, as well, in the structure and constitution
 
Alcaro 4
of sexuality.” (1685). Therefore, women who live in patriarchal societies strengthen their
bonds with other each other thr
ough the struggle for feminism, a n etwork of “women
- promoting-the-interests-of-
women” –
a structure in which it is easy to transition to
“women
-loving-
women.” (Sedgwick, 1685). In order to better understand these different 
kinds of relationships, Sedgwick 
coins the term “homosociality,” a term that differs from homosexuality in that it is a broad understanding of the “social bonds between persons of  the same sex.” (1684). For women, who share strong bonds that can be maternal, familial,
social, economic, political, or erotic, homosociality is not necessarily dichotomous with homosexuality; in the contrary, the lines between the two cate gories are blurred, at times even fluid. (1685). Men, however, set up their relationships much differently; in light of  their assumptions that male dominant society mean a heterosexual one, male
homosociality becomes distanced from homosexuality as a “safe way” of talking about  men’s relationships with one another. Desire or eroticism is limited strictly to the realm of 
homosexuality which, for many men (especially of the 19
th
century), is far too taboo to be broached. In fact, for men of the 19
th
century and even some today, the idea of  homosexuality is so forbidden that it is not only unspeakable, but unthinkable even within their own minds. What then, is a heterosexual male to do in order to e xpress desire within a homosocial context?
Literary Scholar David Richter summarizes Sedgwick’s theory nicely, saying that in light of such negative feelings for homosexuality, “ homosex
ual panic is assuaged by
triangulation through a woman.” (1620). Men express the desires they feel for one another
by getting involved with a woman, and transposing their desires through her. In light of 
such a theory, Watson’s actions in
The Sign of Four 
begin to make a bit more sense.
