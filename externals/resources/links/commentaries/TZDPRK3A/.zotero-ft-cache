in
its associat ion
with the

that

theman
of
talent
(whois al wa ys
ahead
of
th e
crowd)
an d th e man
ofgenius (wh o
remains

Sensei,
in
J(okoro,
mor eov er, res ists being made
th e
obje ct of
th e
yo un g stu dent 's mim eti c att ent ion s. And man y
critics
have
argued
that
if Kok oro
has
a "me ssag e,"
it
is
about
the impor tance
of
th e
student's
ability
to
stop imit at
ing Se ns ei , to "g ro w up "
an d be
hi s own per son .
If
anythi ng, we
ten d to thi nk
ofS6se ki (or
at
least
th e
late S6 sek i) as
an autho r
preocc upied with
th e
dangers
of
imi tat ion . In his fa mou s
1914
speec h del iver ed to
stud ents at
Gakushilin,
"My
Individualism,"
he
describes
his realiz ation
during
his stay
in
London
that
he "had
been
no better
than
a ro otl ess , flo ati ng wee d, dr if t ing aim les sly
an d
wholly
cente red on
others-
'other center ed'
(tanin
hon'i)
in
th e
sense
of
an
imitator,
a
ma n
wh o ha s som eon e
else
dri nk his
liquor
for
him,
who
asks
th e
other
fellow's
opinion
of
it
an d
makes
that
opinion
his own
without
ques tion ,"3 He
then
goes
onto
expre ss his
ferv ent wish
that the
young me n
of hi s da y would
"become
self-centered
(;il<.o
hon'i)"
an d
rea ch, as
he
ha d
after
much
effort, .
th e
conviction
that
I wa s
th e
single
most
important
person
in
my li fe , wh ile
others
were onl y sec ond ary ."4 S6seki's
exhortation
that
Japan's
young
me n
find
their
ow n
way
an d
identify
the ir own
desir es is
some thinghe
was worki ng
out
at
the
same
time,
in
novelistic form,
in
his so- cal led "lat e tr il og y" (o f
which
Kol<.oro
was
th e
fina l volum e),
All
of
these
nov els , as
has
been
repeatedly
pointed out,
deal
wi th th e th eme
of jeal ousy
an d
triangular
desire.
The
lat terof the se, as fi rs t Re ne Gir ar d
an d
then
Eve
Kosofsky Sedgwick
have
taught
u s, i s
acti vate d not
by
th e
intrinsic
attractiveness
of
the
object
bu t
by
our imita tion
of
someone
els e's des ire fo r it . Gi rar d cal led
this
other person
th e
"mediator."
In
nov els fro m
Don Qui xot e
to
Prou st, Gira rd argu ed,
on e sought
in
vain
for
wha t he
called
"spont aneous, " or
"lin ear" desir e
roo ted in
the
autonomy
of
th e
self
an d
directly
tra inedon th e
object.
Don
Quixote
desired what
his
mediator
th e
fictional
knight-errant
Amadis
de
Gauldesired . And Prou st's
nar
rator
knew
his
own des ire on ly
through
the
mediation
of
his
favorite
aut hor s or
of
th e
aristocrats
whose
society
he
so sno bbi shl y cov ete d. Des ire
in
its nove listi c
form
was al wa ys
rou ted thr ough
an
other.
Gir ard call ed
it
"de sir e acco rdi ng to
th e
Other."5
When on e
copies
another's
desire,
th is of ten
leads
to
riv alr y since
both th e
subject
an d
th e
mediat or are
by
definition
focused
on the
same
object.
6
Because
the
mimetic relation
tothe
mediator
is
primary an d
th e
desir e fel t fo r
th e
object
i s on ly it s
secondary
resul t, moreo ver,
th e
bond
of riva lry
ca n
often
seem more
imp ort ant tha n the
desire
for
th e
object
itself.

Bet wee n Men ,
in wh ic h sh e
tr ac es a si mi lar move
into
modernity,

along

homoso cial con

fro m openl y ackn owle dged

of a

In

generic
dimension
as we ll , mO vi ng fro m
what sh e

of open-ended

ha ve ar gu ed , w e
can

something
similar
to
this
in th e
ar c of S6seki's

car eer : nam ely a shi ft fr om
th e
simi larl y "sun ny" homo socia lity
an d
episodic
narrative
of
"I

(not
coincidentally
inspired
by Stern e's
Tristram Shandy),
where women
are sim ply exc lud ed

intensely novelist ic

in whi ch th e homo

As
Girard
points
out, already
in
Don Quixote
on e
fin ds examp les of
both
external
and inte rnal
mediation
of desi re. Whi le
external
mediation
(Don
Quixote's
open admir ation
for Amad is
de
Gaul)
is
perh aps what the
novel
is
best
known
for,
internal mediation
comes
into
play
in the inte rpol ate d
tal e of
the
two frie nds Ansel mo
and
Lothario,
th e
former of
whom
tests
th e
lo yal ty of his wi fe
by
asking
th e latt er to attempt to
sedu ce he r,
with
dis astr ous cons equ ence s. The
medi ati on here
is "int erna l" bec aus e,
unlike
Don Quixo te
and
Amadis,
th e
social
dist anc e betw een the
tw o fri end s is
minimal and because their
frien dship masks powe rful
currents
of rivalr y
an d
hatre d. Gira rd argues
that
this
co-existence
in
Cervan tes's work of
unabashed imita tion and
dis avo wed riv alr y sho ws
that
Cerv antes has
grasped
"the ext rem e
fo rm s of
imitated
desire"
and
paradoxi cally confirms
the uni ty
of
th e
wo rk a s w el l a s
th e
unity
of "novelistic literature" itse lf.

S6 se ki , fo r his
