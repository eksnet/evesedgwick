TENDENCIES By Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. 281 pp. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press. Cloth, $44.95. Paper, $15.95. THE APPARITIONAL LESBIAN Female Homosexuality and Modern Culture. By Terry Castle. Illustrated. 307 pp. New York: Columbia University Press.

SEVERAL of my professional acquaintances consider themselves to be theoretically impaired. Although they are by no means theory bashers, they balk at deconstructionist jargon and at words invaded by hyphens, slashes and brackets. They would require organizations like the Modern Language Association to provide translators who can render the post-modern into the vernacular. But when it comes to the latest works of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Terry Castle, even the linguistically squeamish seem to overcome their phobias.

Ms. Sedgwick is a professor of English at Duke University and the author of two groundbreaking works in the relatively new field of criticism some of its practitioners call "queer theory." In "Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire" (1985) she examined the "heavily freighted bonds between men" that dominate the plots of novels, even when those plots ostensibly revolve around women. In her second book, "Epistemology of the Closet" (1990), she explored our society's "enduring incoherence" in defining homosexuality and heterosexuality. While working on that book, Ms. Sedgwick also wrote a number of sensational essays with titles like "Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl" and "How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay: The War on Effeminate Boys." These essays, delivered at academic conferences, exploded like grenades into newspaper accounts and were promptly attacked for their depravity by conservatives like Roger Kimball, the author of "Tenured Radicals."

"Tendencies" is a selection of Ms. Sedgwick's brilliant and provocative essays, with their original attention-grabbing titles and occasionally with prefaces that put the controversies surrounding the essays into perspective. Ms. Sedgwick's strategy is to concentrate on well-known works by Henry James, Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde, Willa Cather, Denis Diderot and others, in order to explore the sexual, social and political agendas that she believes are hidden within them. Ms. Sedgwick not only has a witty and engaging style, but an ability to link post-modern concerns to contemporary issues like AIDS, breast cancer, the nature of addictive behavior and therapists who try to force male children into their proper "gender assignment."

The associations she makes are novel and imaginative, though not always to everyone's taste. For instance, in the essay titled "A Poem Is Being Written," Ms. Sedgwick links lyric rhythms and poetic techniques like enjambment to spanking. "When I was a little child," she writes, "the two most rhythmic things that happened to me were spanking and poetry." In this piece she also throws in examples of her own poetry, which unfortunately lacks the inventiveness of her prose. In other essays, Ms. Sedgwick makes the sentimental error of including her meditations on the AIDS-related deaths of a few gay male friends. Though touchingly written, these reminiscences are unlikely to interest any readers except friends of the departed.
