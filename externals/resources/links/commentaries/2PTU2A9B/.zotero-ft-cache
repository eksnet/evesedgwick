'Queer Theory' Is Entering The Literary Mainstream

''It's about trying to understand different kinds of sexual desire and how the culture defines them,'' said Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, the Newman Ivey White professor of English at Duke University. ''It's about how you can't understand relations between men and women unless you understand the relationship between people of the same gender, including the possibility of a sexual relationship between them.''

Ms. Sedgwick, 47, was sitting in the shadows at a restaurant in midtown Manhattan and trying to explain ''queer theory,'' the academic field she has helped create. Her voice is light and fragile, her message authoritative.

In academic circles, Eve Sedgwick is known as ''the straight woman who does gay studies.'' But ''please don't use that term 'straight,' '' she asked.

Queer theory, which Ms. Sedgwick developed along with Judith Butler, a professor at the University of California, Berkley, is a prism through which scholars examine literary texts. Queer theorists scorn traditional definitions of ''homosexual'' and ''heterosexual.'' There is no strict demarcation between male and female, they argue. Instead, queer theorists say, taking their cue from the historian Michel Foucault, sexuality exists on a continuum, with some people preferring sex partners of the opposite sex, others preferring partners of both sexes. Only since the 19th century, queer theorists argue, have sexual definitions become rigid. And along with this rigidity, they say, has come anxiety, panic and intensifying homophobic attitudes.

For these scholars, literature is embedded with homophobic fears and anxieties. Looking at literary works through the prism of queer theory, they argue, clarifies them and explains their mysteries.

In recent years, queer theory has become one of the most popular fields for graduate students in English literature. Once on the fringes of academic life, it was a major topic at last month's meeting of the Modern Language Association in Toronto, and today Ivy League English departments are recruiting queer theorists.

''I know many people are disturbed by it,'' said Morris Dickstein, Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center and Queens College of the City University. ''But over the last 15 years, with the rise of cultural studies, queer theory has become more and more part of mainstream literary scholarship.''

In provocatively titled essays like ''Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl,'' ''How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay'' and ''Is the Rectum Straight?: Identification and Identity in 'The Wings of the Dove,' '' Ms. Sedgwick took texts traditionally seen as heterosexual and exposed what she says are their homoerotic themes.

Labels like ''heterosexual'' and ''homosexual'' are societal inventions, Ms. Sedgwick says, and in her essay on ''La Religieuse'' by Diderot, she calls them ''rich and murderous and contradictory.'' Like Foucault, she sees desire and repression as being at the root of all politics.

Ms. Sedgwick said she never thought of queer theory as a basis for political action. But in recent months, her writings have been the inspiration for the increasingly vocal group Sex Panic, which is fighting what it sees as an oppressive attempt to restrict gay sexual behavior: efforts to close bathhouses and movie theaters for instance, in the belief that they are sites of sexual behavior that has a high risk of spreading AIDS. ''I feel very privileged,'' Ms. Sedgwick said, ''that queer theory has been useful for political work that seems important for me.''

Ms. Sedgwick first developed her theories through a reading of Dickens's novel ''Our Mutual Friend'' in an essay she had published in Raritan in 1983. ''Our Mutual Friend'' is ostensibly about a sexual triangle: two men, Eugene Wrayburn and Bradley Headstone, in love with the same woman, Lizzie Hexam.

''But the dynamics that drive the plot are the volatile relations between the two men, who are rivals,'' Ms. Sedgwick said. One man becomes obsessed with the other, and there are paranoid chases. It was not, she said, that this was a homosexual novel or that Dickens was homosexual, but rather, she said: ''You can't understand relations between men and women characters unless you understand the relationship between people of the same gender. Also important is the way homophobia is aroused in a particular cultural setting.'' In this novel's case, she said, the ''cultural setting'' was England of the mid-1800's, where a strong attraction between two men would not necessarily culminate in sex but would lead to a kind of ''homosexual panic.''

She said the essay, ''Homophobia, Misogyny and Capital: The Example of 'Our Mutual Friend,' '' met with ''disbelief, interest, disbelief. No one would hire me.''

She incorporated the paper into a book, ''Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire,'' published in 1985. In it, she examined texts by Shakespeare, Tennyson and George Eliot, among others, for buried homoerotic themes. The book appeared around the time that gay and lesbian studies were becoming popular, and in 1988 Duke hired her.

In ''Epistemology of the Closet,'' published in 1990, Ms. Sedgwick carried her theories one step forward, looking at Melville's Billy Budd, Wilde, Nietzsche and Proust. Ms. Sedgwick was interested, she said, in the problem of knowledge, in the ways in which one character in a literary text is described as knowing something that is secret, often that another character is homosexual.

It is from essays like this that Sex Panic activists like Michael Warner, a professor of English at Rutgers University, have derived their ideology. ''Dozens and dozens of scholars have followed her,'' said Mr. Warner, author of the 1995 book ''Fear of a Queer Planet.'' ''She has enabled people to think more broadly about sexual politics.

''H.I.V. prevention requires taking into account the diversity of peoples' sex lives, that prevention should be grounded in people's desires and pleasures.'' This means, Mr. Warner said, having H.I.V. prevention in bathhouses and movie theaters instead of closing them down.

Some of the strongest criticism of Sex Panic and queer theory comes from other homosexuals. ''Queer theory seeks to overturn society's traditional views of sex and sexuality,'' the journalist Gabriel Rotello said. ''No one would be stigmatized, no matter what they do; we're not going to care about social approval. They think society is inherently repressive. But in this epidemic it is impossible to advocate a system in which everything is okay.''

Andrew Sullivan, another critic, said he regarded queer theorists ''as a sect restricted to the academy, which they control as a cartel.''

''Their essential argument,'' he said, ''is that the whole notion of gender is wrong, there is no such thing as responsibility, and any attempt to go by the rules is oppressive.''

Ms. Sedgwick said: ''I think it's ridiculous to say 'queer theory' is not about ethical responsibility. There is an ethical urgency about queer theory that is directed at the damage that sexual prohibitions and discrminations do to people.''

Ms. Sedgwick has often said she feels ''queer.'' In her autobiographical writings, she describes a fairly conventional sex life of a married woman but writes of fantasies that put her sexually in ''all the far extremes.'' In one essay, ''A Poem Is Being Written,'' she writes about associating the rhythm of being spanked as a child with the rhythms of poetry. The essay, she said, ''is about the relationship between art and sex, between poetry and those for whom spanking fantasies, or spanking behavior during sex, are part of their sex life.''

Since 1969, Ms. Sedgwick has been married to Hal Sedgwick, a professor of visual perception at the City University of New York's College of Optometry. For the most part, they have lived apart, seeing each other on weekends. Ms. Sedgwick has shared her home in Durham with a gay male colleague at Duke. ''Who you have sex with and who you have domesticity with shouldn't necessarily be the same,'' she said.

Both seem satisfied with the arrangement. ''I think I was sensitized at an early age to the potential limitations'' of a traditional family life, Hal Sedgwick said in a recent interview. ''There's an awful lot about the nuclear family that has never appealed to me. I never wanted children.''

Eve Sedgwick was also raised in a home that was open to ideas about alternative family structures. ''We talked a lot about gender and sex,'' she said of her family. ''It was not assumed that everybody was heterosexual.'' She grew up in Bethesda, Md., one of three children, two girls and a boy. She has called it a traditional assimilated Jewish family in which learning was prized. Her father was a scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, her mother a high school English teacher. It was a ''very lucky childhood,'' Ms. Sedgwick said.

In her essay ''A Poem Is Being Written,'' she writes of the trauma of finding out that a beloved junior high school teacher had been arrested for a homosexual incident. That was how she discovered ''queerness,'' she said.

Ms. Sedgwick attended Cornell and graduate school at Yale, ''a very frigid place,'' she said. ''There wasn't even feminism, let alone gay and lesbian studies.'' When she left Yale in 1975, she was hired by Hamilton College, which had recently become co-ed. With other young women on the faculty there, she educated herself about the new feminist scholarship, which included Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert's ''Mad Woman in the Attic'' and Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics.'' ''It was an exhilarating, wonderful group.''

Ms. Sedgwick's best-known work is the 1986 essay ''The Beast in the Closet,'' about Henry James' short story ''The Beast in the Jungle.'' It is usually read as a heterosexual love story about John Marcher, who cannot the return the love of a woman, May Bartram. Only when Bartram dies, the traditional reading goes, does Marcher realize the extent of his loss.

Ms. Sedgwick reads the story differently. To her it is about a man who is secretly gay but cannot acknowledge it. May Bartram realizes his problem and tries to help him understand it.

In the story's final paragraphs, as Marcher hurls himself on Bartram's grave, he looks up and sees a stranger, a man: ''There was a kind of hunger in his look,'' Henry James wrote. Marcher was conscious of ''the image of a scarred passion,'' James wrote, ''something that profaned the air: and in the second that, roused, startled, shocked, he was yet the next moment looking after it, as it went, with envy.''

In Ms. Sedgwick interpretation, the anonymous stranger is looking for a homosexual encounter in the cemetery. ''What is strikingly open in 'The Beast in the Jungle,' '' she writes, is a ''man's desire for man -- and the denial of that desire.''

In 1991, Ms. Sedgwick found out she had breast cancer. After treatment, it recurred in late 1996. She is moving to New York and is teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center. Part of the decision to teach at City University, she said, was a result of her illness. ''Hal and I realized we wanted to be in the same place,'' she said. ''When I realized that I don't have much time left, it made me want to make sure that I am using my time to do the things that I really needed to be doing.'' Ms. Sedgwick has just rented an apartment in New York. ''Even when I move up here, we'll be living in separate places,'' Ms. Sedgwick said, though near each other.

Increasingly, she said, she finds herself withdrawing from scholarship. ''The illness makes me less patient. I've found myself doing a lot of art and weaving. The physical world, the things that come in through the fingers and the eyes, they have been a miraculous discovery.

''I have lived over a year with knowing I will probably die of this disease. And I have been interested in what it's all going to be like.'' Lately, she has been studying Buddhism. ''In Buddhism, gender seems very ephemeral,'' Ms. Sedgwick said.
