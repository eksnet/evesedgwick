I Introduction
Eve Kos ofs ky Sed gwi ck die d in Apr il 200 9,  prompting this forum. A s a professor of literary criticism, Sedgwick’s work was brought to the attention of geographers through her influential co nt ri bu ti on s to ‘q ue er th eo ry ’ (S ed gwi ck, 1990, 1994) . Her work had a sign ific ant impact on ear ly geo gra phi cal res ear ch on sex ual ity wh ic h so ug ht to ma te ri al iz e he r id ea s an d  demonstrate how (homo)sexuality is known in  place-specific ways. As her work diversified to co ns id er qu es ti on s of em ot io ns , af fe ct an d   pedagogy, it was taken up by a broader range of geographers. Out of these interactions, her  thi nki ng bec ame inc rea sin gly att une d to the  productivity of spatial thinking. Nonetheless, geographers have tended to be understated in their acknowledgement of her influence on our  own theorizing. The four essays in this review foru m redr ess that silen ce. Our own contr ibut ion offers an overview of Sedgwick’s work, outlin- ing how it has been taken up by geographers, co ns id er in g th e ex te nt to wh ic h he r wr it in g uti li zed a geo gra phi cal ima gin ati on and poi nti ng to further areas of work.
1 Queer thinking 
 Epistemology of the Closet 
(1990) has probably ha d th e gr ea te st in fl ue nc e on ge og ra ph ic al research on sexualities. In this work Sedgwick  ar gu ed th at ‘t he cl os et ’ ha d sh ap ed ga y li fe throughout the 20th century and continues to do so. The ‘epistemology of the closet’ is the means by which homosexuality exists through a regime of the ‘open secret’, something that is known through not-knowing. The concept of the cl os et an d it s ep is te mi c ef fe ct s ha ve be en deployed by scholars from a range of disciplines (including Geography) and used to understand  the functioning of sexual relations in a broader  ra ng e of geo gr ap hi c se tt in gs . Yet , Mi ch ae l Brown (2000) has critiqued Sedgwick’s use of  the spatial metaphor of ‘the closet’ demonstrat- ing the complexities of attempts to practise this mode of analysis in material spaces at a variety of scales. Geographers have also questioned the limits of ‘the closet’ as a mechanism for under- sta ndi ng the dyn ami cs of que er vis ibi lit ies in national contexts where the homo/hetero binary is no t th e pr im ar y me an s of un de rs ta nd in g sexualities (Tucker, 2009). Sedgwick’s queer critique has had a signifi- ca nt in fl ue nc e th ro ug h Gi bs on -G ra ha m’ s (1996) feminist critique of political economy.

2 Affective thinking 
Shame is an affective state that has been consid- er ed by man y qu ee r th eo ri st s in an att em pt to re t hi nk ‘g ay pr i de ’ a nd th e e m ot io n s th at su rr ou nd it (P ro by n, 20 05 ). Ce rt ai nl y, Se dgw ic k’ s ini ti al eng age me nt wi th Sil va n To mk ins ’ wo rk (Se dg wic k and Fr ank , 199 5) seems to have been motivated by an interest in ‘s ha me’ tha t dev elo pe d fr om her qu eer wor k. Bu t this engagement also arose out of Sedgwick’s initial treatment for breast cancer in 1991 which inspired her to reflect on the ways in which her  mas tec to my al ter ed her own und ers ta ndi ng of her  gender and sexuali ty. In his theorization of affect, Tomkins distin- guished between the ‘drives’ that humans expe- ri en ce (c om pe ll in g us to ea t an d br ea th e) an d ou r  experience of affects (such as fear and anger) that are self- validating and may have any object. Sedgwick and Frank (1995) were drawn to his sug ges tio n tha t sha me ope rat es onl y aft er int ere st or enjoyment has been activated in an engage- me nt wi th th e ‘s tr an ge ’ (a nd se rv es to in hi bi t on e or both of these affects). In a later application of  Tomkins’ ideas, Sedgwick reminded her readers that:
Tomkins considers sexuality ‘the drive in which the affec tive compo nent plays the large st role’: not only is it ‘the least imperious of all the drives,’ but it is the only one ‘in which activation of the drive even without consummation has a rewarding rather than a punishing quality. It is much more exciting and  rewar ding, ’ h e under states , ‘to feel sexua lly arouse d  than to feel hungry or thirsty.’ (Sedgwick, 2003: 20)
This area of work, although acknowledged by so me ge og ra ph er s in ter es te d in de ve lo pi ng non-representational theories (Anderson, 2006; Thr ift , 200 4) , rem ain s ecl ip sed by the dom i- nance of Deleuzian understandings of affect in contemporary geography. Moreover, given that Sedgwick’s interventions have been significant in developing geographies of sexualities, further  wo rk on af fe ct wo ul d be fr ui tf ul in th is pa rt ic ul ar  geographical subdiscipline (although see Lim, 2007).
3 Against paranoid thinking 
Sedgwick (2003: 1) described her final book,
Touch ing Feeli ng 
, as ‘a pr oj ec t to ex pl or e  promising tools and techniques for nondualistic th ou gh t an d pe da g og y ’. Th i s wr it in g wa s concerned with thinking about the performativ- ity of knowledge to consider what the pursuit and production of knowledge
does
. Sedgwick  offered an alternative to the ‘paranoid thinking’ which, she argued, reduces all theoretical inves- tigations to the revelation of (already ‘known’) un de r ly in g po we r st ru ct ur es an d fo rm s of  oppression within society. Sedgwick questioned  the effects (and affects) of these forms of para- noid knowl edge produ ction , consi deri ng how they serve to shut down innovative alternatives to th e st at us qu o. Th e alt er na ti ve Se dg wi ck  offered was to embrace ‘reparative’ modes of  weak thinking that harnessed pleasure, hope and  the possibilities of ameliorating social problems in th e pr es en t. Th is re pa ra ti ve me th od ha s inspired several recent geographical investiga- tio ns (Br own e, 200 9; Gib son -Gr aha m, 200 6; Lim, 2007) and sits well alongside the growing interest in similar forms of affirmative critique (Connolly, 2008).

). She no te d th at ‘s pa ti al iz in g di sc ip li ne s su ch as geography and anthropology do, though, have the advantage of permitting ecological or sys- tems approaches to such issues as identity and   performance’ (Sedgwick, 2003: 8). Space in this final work moves beyond the (purely) metapho- rical and takes a defining role in enabling other  mod es of thi nki ng, add res sin g geo gra phe rs ’ consistent critique that she failed to consider the material spatiality of the practices she theorized. It is unfortunate that she did not have an oppor- tunity to pursue this line of inquiry further. The three contributions that follow consider  the particular ways in which Sedgwick’s work  has cap tur ed the ima gin ati on of geo gra phe rs . Michael Brown revisits Sedgwick’s work on the epistemology of the closet, demonstrating how its use by geo gr aph ers of sex ual iti es has rev eal ed  so me of the lim its of her con cep tu ali zat ion . Gerda Roelvink and Michelle Carnegie explore how geo gra phe rs hav e tak en up Sed gwi ck’ s cri ti que of ‘p ara noi d thi nki ng’ and exa min e how the reparative mode of research has been art ic ula ted thr oug h Gib so n-G rah am’ s (19 96, 20 06 ) en gag em en t wi th Sed gwi ck’ s id ea s. Finally, Ben Anderson offers a critical appraisal of Sed gwi ck’ s the or iza tio ns of aff ect , and ev alu - at es ho w th is ap pr oac h to af fe ct iv e re la ti on s is of  use to geographers. Inter esti ngly, and as this collecti on attes ts, th er e ha ve be en fe w at te mp ts to ma ke th e conne ction s betwee n Sedg wick ’s vario us contr i-  butions. Bringing these strands together here, we hope to spark work that will work put the closet, Christmas effect, paranoid thinking, pedagogy an d af fe ct in to di al og ue wi th ea ch ot he r to advan ce geogr aphic al rese arch. For examp le, fur the r wor k int ers ect ing the clo set wit h aff ect ive geographies could move beyond the closet as a  place of sexual (un)kn owing and shame to reconsider the spatial affects of the contradic- tions of privacy/disclosure, public/private and  kno wle dge /ig nor anc e. Fin all y, geog rap her s would do well to reconsider the performative effects of our writing strategies and actively strive to avoid reproducing paranoid thinking in our research.

I first read 
Epistemology of the Closet 
in 1993, towards the end of my graduate school days at UBC, and I admit that I did not make much of  it at the time. A boyfriend bought it for me, try- ing to woo a theory-laden graduate student (he eventually succeeded). But most of her dense and twisty writing was lost on me. I did not un de r s ta nd he r pr os e, bu t I al s o wa s no t interested in her project, though I should have  been. My theoretical sights then were set on rad- ical democ rati c theo ry.

It wa s du ri ng th at ti me th at th e so -c all ed  ‘s pa ti al tu rn ’ in so ci al th eo ry wa s gi vi ng geogr apher s an intel lectu al reach that seeme d  refreshing and exciting. A central feature of this spati al turn was the prol ifera tion of spati al meta-  phors. Cultural studies seemed to be stuffed full of sp ace s, sit es, con ste lla tio ns , pla cem ent s, loca tion s, cart ogra phi es, and of cour se mapp ings . Geo gr aph ers wer e exc it ed bu t war y: exc ite d   because it seemed that (finall y) critica l scholar s were starting to cultivate geographical imagina- tion s; war y beca use thei r spa tial lan guag e seem ed  so frequently to be just that (Smith and Katz, 1993). The goal was often not to infuse cultural the or y wi th spa ti ali ty , but rat her to po ur ol d  intellec tual wine into new rhetor ical bottles. So it was in this context that I tried to read  Sedgwick’s tome on the closet. The central the- sis of the book was that ‘virtually any aspect of  modern Western culture, must be, not merely incom plete , but damag ed in its cent ral subs tance to th e de gr ee th at it doe s not in co rp or at e a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual def ini ti on’ (Se dgw ick , 199 0: 1). For me, the  book’s central thesis was of secondary impor- tance to the very foregrounding of its object: the closet. It is a spatial metaphor that conveys the den ia l, er asu re , an d con cea lme nt of que er pe opl e, their desires, and their sexual relations. The term of course had been in popular lexicon for at least 20 years, but Sedgwick was the first to make us think about it more fully. Perhaps the most refreshing point to take was thattheclosetwasa

It s du al it y wa s al so a ke y – if ir on ic – th em e. The closet, Sedgwick insisted, was a knowing-  by-not- knowing. People might know a friend or  character was gay, but without that individual ever having articulated it herself. People might know that a particular neighborhood or city was ‘gay’, without ever having set foot there, or had  in-depth knowledge of that place. Heterosexuals mi ght cr im in ali ze or con dem n ‘ho mos exu al ’ sex-act s they themsel ves enjoy with the opposit e sex. One could be both in and out of the closet simultaneously. Whether or not one was ‘out’ migh t comp lex ly depe nd on thei r mult isc ala r  tim e geog rap hies . Fur ther mor e, it is not red ucib le down to late capitalism or patriarchy. Sedgwick  of fe re d in s ig ht an d la ng ua ge to ge t at th e structuration of heteronormativity. As a cri ti cal hum an geo gr aph er, how eve r, I was frustrated by all the metaphorical, non- material and relentlessly textual dimensions of  the book (Sedgwick was, after all, an English Professor). Her arguments about the centrality of the closet, and its paradoxical epistemology, were based in careful reading of various texts. I re ad th e ex clu si ve fo cu s on th e te xt as th e ex cl u- siv e spa ce of the clo set as pot ent ial ly bli ndi ng us to th e ma te ri al it y of th e cl os et , an d it s th eo re ti ca l  possibiliti es for critical human geography. Had  I not just been taught by a previous generation of geographers that social relations and struc- tur es wer e alw ays -al rea dy spa ti al? For me, it was then a short leap to reconceptualizing the closet as not ‘merely’ a clever and revealing spatial metaphor, but also a geography. I began to think  of the spatialities and scalarity of concealment, of denial, and of erasure of gay men. I began to reconceptualize the closet as a spatial structure and a set of spatial practices (Brown, 2000). B u t al l th at wa s s o lo n g ag o . Do we st i ll ne e d a theory of the closet in these ‘post-gay’ times? At a time when there has been widespread main- streaming and acceptance of queer people and  relations, certainly some queer academics have argued against the dominance of the closet, and  que er the ory has mov ed bey ond the con cep t towards intersectionality. I consequently agree that there are limits to the closet’s usefulness in theorizing hetero (and homo) normativities and homophobias. But
