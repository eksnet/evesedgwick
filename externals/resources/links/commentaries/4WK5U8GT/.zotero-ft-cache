Loose reading? Sedgwick, Austen and critical practice
1
 
Vincent Quinn The cover of the November 9, 1998 issue of 
The New Republic
features two bare-chested men in an affectionate embrace; their heads have been removed and replaced with those of  Shakespea re and Henry James. Accompanying the image is the headline: ' Literary License: How "Queer Theory" mindlessly sexualizes Henry James, William Shakespeare, and just about everything else'. As one might expect, the accompany ing Lee Siegel article is hardly positive in its assessmen t of academic debates on same-sex desire. Instead, Siegel uses his review of six books by Eve Sedgwick, Michael Moon, David Halperin and Michael Warner to attack 'the "queering" of literature'.

This article will examine the assumptions structuring Siegel's argument, especially the different attitudes to 'reading' encoded in his and Sedgwick's work. As well as exploring the strengths and weaknesses of Sedgwick's highly contested version of 'queer theory',

the essay will investigate the general function of 'reading' in critical practice. Arguing that Sedgwick's reading practices represent a paradigm shift fr om 'close reading' to a less attentive form of textual analysis, this article uses Sedgwick to ask  why reading matters: what
is
it, and what is it
 for 
? These questions necessarily impact on the way we think about the discipline of English; however -- as this essay will show -- they also have implications for political activism, creative writing, and teaching practice in schools and colleges. Lee Siegel's
 New Republic
article is not marked by subtlety of thought or expression. Rather, it is a biting polemic from a commentator (and a journal) renowned for attacks on so-called political correctness. Cranky though it is, Siegel's i ntervention gains weight through its prominent position. What's more, his account is a useful guide to the unease that lesbian and gay research has provoked among r ight-wing commentators. Discussing 'the queer enterpris e' (p. 32), Siegel insists that: 'Queer theorists . . . wish to dissolve the categories of sexual identity and, with them, the way in which society has
 
2 invested sexual identities with moral value, endorsing some sexual identities and stigmatising others. Queers are engaged in a vast theoretical project of breaking up fix ed sexual identities into the fluidity of sexual acts or practices' (p. 32). Siegel's failure to distinguish between 'queers' and 'queer theorists' suggests a slippage between social and academic panics: a fear that his assimilationist position is being swamped by a queer non-conformism originating in liberal universities. Complaining that 'academia . . . [has] sexualized every thing', he writes that 'nowhere has the sexualization of reality proceeded so intensely and so relentlessly as in the seminar room' (p. 30). This peculiar construction -- which is highlighted on the
 New  Republic
's cover, as well as in Siegel's by-line -- implies that desire is a foreign body forcibly imposed on the material world. By viewing 'reality' as a recoverable entity -- a material body which, in its original form, does not include the erotic -- Siegel is able to blame 'queer theorists' for 'sexualizing everything'. This blurring of intellectual and socio-sexual anxieties is a symptom of a wider desire to govern the educational system. Thus, Siegel fights back by re-asserting moral and literary value. Speculating that Sedgwick 'and her crowd' are 'not very comfortable' with the ways of  'great writers', he condemns Sedgwick for her 'deadness . . . to beauty and fineness of  perception and fragile inner life' (p. 40). Meanwhile, Foucault may generalize but at l east he 'never dreamed of applying [his generalizations]
to literature
' (p. 38; my emphasis). Such formulations are a familiar response to politically-motivated criticism. As usual, the humanist critic uses a supposedly apolitical aestheticism to protect society against progressivist incursions. Such manoeuv res are more pointed in relation to queer work, however, where fears of institutional i nfection are informed by a homophobic discourse which represents queerness as a contagious disease. Note, for example, Siegel's fear that 'w e will start to become indifferent to --
or perhaps connoisseurs of 
-- physical pain' (p. 42; my emphasis) simply by reading Michael Moon's
 A Small Boy and Others
. Among the many absurdities of this position is the implication that there is a body of 'normal' readers -- Siegel's 'we' -- whose sex lives are as vanilla as their r eading habits. Regulation and surveillance are typical responses to these fears of i ntellectual infection. Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act is a British example of the
 
3 connection between sexual and educational anxieties;

US arguments about the National Endowment for the Arts are broadly comparable. Given this, it is hardly surprising that Henry James and Jane Austen feature so prominently in Siegel's article. Both are usually r epresented as the most incorporeal of writers. Not only were they unmarried and childless, their narrative voices are characterized by irony and apparent detachment. Of all fictional 'realities', theirs have been seen as the most un-'sexualized' .

This -- along with their canonical importance -- is why Sedgwick wants to queer them. It is also why Siegel, from his different perspective, is appalled by readings which centre on fist-fucking and masturbation. Crucially, though, the Siegel/Sedgwick disagreement concerns more than just divergent textual interpretations. The real issue isn't whether James's prose represents 'fisting- as-
écriture
',

it's how those interpretations are produced. What is at stake is not a single interpretation, but reading itself: its protocols and its purpose. This issue becomes clear in  journalistic respon ses to 'Jane Auste n and the Ma sturbating Girl', a Sedg wick essay wh ich Lee Siegel describes as a 'fantasy' (p. 40). The term is meant to be a curt di smissal: the off- hand blow from which Sedgwick's reputation will never recover. Yet the strength of  Sedgwick's essay is that it is, very precisely, a fantasy. If it is to tell us anything, that is how we should approach it.
Masturbating Jane
This is Sedgwick's opening: The phrase itself is already evidence. Roger Kimball in his treatise on educational 'corruption,'
Tenured Radicals
, cites the title 'Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl' from an MLA convention program quite as if he were Perry Mason, the six words a smoking gun. The warm gun that, fo r journalists who have adopted the phrase as an index of depravity in academe, is happiness -- offering the squibby pop . . . that lets absolutely anyone , in t he righteously exciting vicinity of the masturbating girl, feel a very pundit.

4 In the light of Kimball's over-determined response (not to mention Sedgwick's highly- wrought style), a summary of the article might help. The essay, which began as a paper to the Modern Language Association in 1989, notes that although masturbation is no longer execrated, it was heavily policed around the time that modern sexual identities were emerging. Sedgwick then quotes chapter twenty-nine of 
Sense and Sensibility
where Marianne Dashwood ha s risen in great distress to write a letter to Willoughby (with whom she is in love) after he has publicly snubbe d her. Elinor Dashwood is woken by her sister's sobbing and tries to talk to her, only to be told 'ask  nothing; you will soon know all'.

  Sedgwick points out that this is a woman-only scene in which one of the participants is 'vectored' towards a man, while the other (Elinor) is directed towards a woman who happens to be her sister. Citing Paula Bennett's work on Emily Dickinson,

Sedgwick urges the reader to re-think the work of 'such . . . homosocially embedded women authors as Auste n and . . . the Brontës' (p. 115). She argues that although 'homo/hete ro' identities were not available in the late-eighteenth century, 'one "sexual identity" that did exist as such in Austen's times . . . was that of the onanist' (p. 116). Having said that 'the masturbator was only one of the sexual identities subsumed, erase d, or overridden in [the] t riumph of the heterosexist homo/hetero calculu s', she claims that 'the status of the masturbator was uniquely formative' in that it was at the 'center of a remapping of individual identity, will, attention, and privacy along modern lines' (pp. 117-8). Claiming that the novel's 'erotic axis is most obviously the unwavering but difficult love of a woman, Elinor Dashwood, for a woman, Marianne Dashwood', Sedgwick argues that Marianne's 'erotic identity, in turn, is not in the first place either a same-sex-loving one or a cross-sex-loving one (though she loves both women and men), but rather the one that today no longer exists
as
an identity: that of t he masturbating girl' (p. 118; Sedgwick's emphasis). Thus, the 'masturbating girl' of the title is Marianne Dashwood -- an identification which Sedgwick adumbrates by comparing Marianne's symptomology with a supposed case history of onanism dated 1881.
