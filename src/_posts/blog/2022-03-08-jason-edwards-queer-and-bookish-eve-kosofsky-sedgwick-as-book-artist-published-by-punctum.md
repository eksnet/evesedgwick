Jason Edwards' new book, *[Queer and Bookish: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick as Book Artist](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/queer-and-bookish-eve-kosofksy-sedgwick-as-book-artist/)* was published by Punctum on March 3. 

*[Queer and Bookish: Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick as Book Artist](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/queer-and-bookish-eve-kosofksy-sedgwick-as-book-artist/)* represents the first book-length study to explore the intersections of Sedgwick’s critical writing, poetry, and, most importantly, book art, making the case that her art criticism, especially her meditations on domestic and nineteenth-century photography, and “artist’s book” projects are as formally complex and brilliant, conceptually significant and life-changing, as her literary criticism and theory. 

[**Jason Edwards** ](https://www.york.ac.uk/history-of-art/staff/edwards/)is a Professor of Art History at the University of York, where he works at the intersections of queer and vegan theory, and on British art history in its global contexts in the period from *c*.1760-1940. He is the author of the Routledge Critical Thinkers volume on *Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick* (Routledge, 2009), among other works, as well as the editor of *[Bathroom Songs: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick As a Poet ](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/bathroom-songs-eve-kosofsky-sedgwick-as-a-poet/)*(punctum books, 2017), which includes Sedgwick’s uncollected poems.
