In July of 2020 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's physical archive moved to the [Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History & Culture](https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/bingham) in Duke University’s Rubenstein Library. A finding aid for the archive is now live on the Duke University website and can be accessed [here](https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/sedgwickevekosofsky).
