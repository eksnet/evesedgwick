Students of Eve Sedgwick’s at the CUNY Graduate Center have formed a group, chartered by the Doctoral Students' Council, to practice some of the book-arts presented in Sedgwick's unique course, ""(newwindow)How To Do Things With Words and Other Materials":/teaching/how-to-do-things-with-words-and-other-materials.html". The Text Textile Texture Studio (or 3Text Studio), as the group is called, takes its inspiration from the original classes, as well as the exhibition that was part of the 2010 "(newwindow)Spanking and Poetry":/blog/spanking-and-poetry-conference-cuny.html conference. 3Text Studio has held events for making accordion books, hexaflexagon books, articulated dolls, and other activities. Studio events are open to members and friends of the Graduate Center community as well as graduate students from other institutions. 

"Eve was incredibly generous -- setting up her office as a fully-stocked studio for students in the department to use. When that closed, many of us wanted not only to continue doing the work ourselves, but to help other people discover how satisfying and inspiring it can be,” said Annie Cranstoun, co-chair of 3Text.  You can see some of the work that has emerged from the Studio on their "(newwindow)website":http://3textstudio.wordpress.com.
