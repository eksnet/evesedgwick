Professor Tavia Nyong’o gave the [Twelfth Annual Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Lecture in Gender & Sexuality Studies](https://www.bu.edu/honoringeve/) on Thursday, April 25 at Boston University. Titled “Who is A Queer Ancestor?”, Dr. Nyong’o’s lecture “explore\[d] the idea of queer ancestry and the prospects of being a “good ancestor.” It reflects upon the process of memorializing the dead and the risks of secular sainthood” and “propose\[d] a model for decolonizing the ancestral, particularly relevant in the digital era.”
