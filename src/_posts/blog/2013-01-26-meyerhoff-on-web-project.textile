T, a friend and former student of Eve Sedgwick, is now working with H. A. Sedgwick on this website. Last summer T began exploring about how the site is structured, and thinking of ways it could eventually be expanded. “I continue to learn new and surprising things about Eve, which is a lot of fun,” T said, “and it’s gratifying to help make archival material available to people who are interested.” In addition to working on the EKS website, T teaches online courses at CUNY, is a co-chair of the "(newwindow)Text Textile Texture Studio":/blog/3textstudio.html, and is writing a doctoral dissertation, tentatively titled <i>Affordances in  the Work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick</i>. If you have questions about the website, please feel free to send them to T at info@evekosofskysedgwick.net.
