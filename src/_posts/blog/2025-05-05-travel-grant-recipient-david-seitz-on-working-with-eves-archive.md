David K. Seitz, associate professor of cultural geography, Harvey Mudd College,  was a 2024-2025 recipient of an Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Research Travel Grant supported by the Foundation. He writes of a serendipitous find in the archive: 



> I came to the Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library under the auspices of the Sallie Bingham Center with a particular interest in Sedgwick’s attention to questions of race, class, and empire. Although I certainly imagined that such questions might come up in her [correspondence](https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/sedgwickevekosofsky) with [Richard Fung](http://www.richardfung.ca/), the acclaimed Chinese-Trinidadian-Canadian queer experimental filmmaker, I had not anticipated the place of the panda in such exchanges.
