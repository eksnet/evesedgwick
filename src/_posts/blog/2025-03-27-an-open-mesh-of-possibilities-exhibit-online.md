"[An 'Open Mesh of Possibilities': Thinking Queerness with Eve Kosofsky Sedgwickâ€™s Archive](https://exhibits.library.duke.edu/exhibits/show/eks/intro)," which "explores the multifaceted ways in which the writings and artwork of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (1950 - 2009) bring queerness into life," is now online. Curated by Katherine Carithers, the exhibit is on display in person at the [Sallie Bingham Center at Duke University until August 2, 2025](https://library.duke.edu/exhibits/2025/Sedgwick).
