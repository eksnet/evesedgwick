Following a clue on the "(newwindow)girlhistorian":https://girlhistorian.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/holy-freakin-girls-intellectual-history/ blog, Jane Hu, writing for Awl, has tracked down a "(newwindow)book review":http://www.theawl.com/2012/09/when-we-were-seventeen/2 written for <i>Seventeen Magazine</i> by Eve Kosofsky when she was 13. The review appeared in <i>Seventeen’s</i> “Curl up and read” column.  Eve’s friend Josh Wilner remarks, “What I enjoy most is the way Eve figures out exactly what the features of a chatty sophisticated literary-review for <i>Seventeen</i> are - and nails it.”  This is the first publication of Eve’s that we know of. If anyone knows of anything earlier, "(newwindow)we’d love to hear about it":/about.html .
