The [2022–2023 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Grants](https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/bingham/grants) are open for application through Duke University's Sallie Bingham Center. 

These grants are named in honor of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and are intended to support research using the Sallie Bingham Center's collection of the [Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Papers](https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/sedgwickevekosofsky).  In addition to supporting academic research aimed at producing publications and dissertations, these grants will support a wide range of other creative projects such as educational initiatives, exhibitions, films, multimedia products, and other artistic works.  These grants are administered by the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture and are funded by the Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Foundation. Sedgwick Travel Grant recipients will be asked to submit a brief report of their grant-supported activities at the conclusion of the grant cycle.
