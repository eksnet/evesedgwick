T﻿he application deadline for the 2023-2024 [Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Travel Grant](https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/bingham/EKS), funded by the Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Foundation and supported by the Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History and Culture, is Friday, February 24, 2023 at 6:00 pm EST. 

This opportunity offers up to $1500 to support research using the [Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Papers](https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/sedgwickevekosofsky).
