index-desc: In this review of an art exhibition about breast cancer, Sedgwick critiques the premise that “artists - <i>all presumed healthy</i> - create works of art that would, somehow, give a ‘voice’ to…women - <i>all presumed voiceless</i> - struggling with the disease.” She also objects to the lack of representation of lesbians in both the exhibition and in cancer research.
