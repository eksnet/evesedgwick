index-desc: Noting that gender criticism can be a euphemism for, among other things, gay and lesbian criticism, Sedgwick distinguishes it from feminist, women's, and men's studies, at the same time observing that "the charting of a space between something called 'sex' and something called 'gender' has been one of the most influential and successful undertakings of feminist thought." Sedgwick gives significant attention to Foulcault's <i>History of Sexuality</i>, as well as "Post-Foucauldian" work.
