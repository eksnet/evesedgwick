The incandescent African American writer Gary Fisher was completely unpublished when he died of AIDS in 1994 at the age of thirty-two. This volume, which includes all of Fisher’s stories and a generous selection from his journals, notebooks, and poems, will introduce readers to a tender, graphic, extravagant, and unswervingly incisive talent. In Fisher’s writings the razor-sharp rage is equalled only by the enveloping sweetness; the raw eroticism by a dazzling writerly elegance. Evocations of a haunting and mobile childhood are mixed in Fisher’s stories with an X-ray view of the racialized sexual vernaculars of gay San Francisco; while the journals braid together the narratives of sexual exploration and discovery, a joyous and deepening vocation as a writer, a growing intimacy with death, and an engagement with racial problematics that becomes ever more gravely and probingly imaginative.

A uniquely intimate, unflinching testimony of the experience of a young, African American gay man in the AIDS emergency, <i>Gary in Your Pocket</i> includes an introduction by Don Belton that describes Fisher’s achievement in the context of other work by Black gay men such as Marlon Riggs and Essex Hemphill, and a biographical afterword by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. -<i>From the jacket copy</i>

"It is impossible to read <i>Gary in Your Pocket</i> and not marvel at [Fisher’s] talent.... Here is the unfolding world of a young gay man of the post-Stonewall generation, learning to embrace a gay identity with innocence and without shame... <i>Gary in Your Pocket</i> redefines the dimensions of African American literature. The body of black gay literature is all the more so enriched." -<i>Mark Haile, Lambda Book Report</i>

"The importance of Gary Fisher’s work cannot be overstated. Presenting a singular and now lost artist, <i>Gary in Your Pocket</i> adds much needed insight into the forum of AIDS and sexuality. It will handily transcend any normal sense of audience or perceived notions of appeal." -<i>Randall Kenan</i>
