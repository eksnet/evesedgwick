  <h3>THE EVE KOSOFSKY SEDGWICK FOUNDATION</h3>
</section>

<p class='intro'>The Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Foundation is a private grantmaking foundation created to preserve, promote, and build on the groundbreaking and hugely influential work of the critical and cultural theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. The Foundation is a natural expansion of many years of cataloguing and consolidating her extensive archive and supporting continuing research and scholarship in dialogue with Sedgwick’s extant papers, books, and artwork. The Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History & Culture in Duke University’s Rubenstein Library is now the permanent home for the physical archive of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, which includes manuscript drafts, papers, and numerous artworks.</p>
