index-desc: Sedgwick considers Terry Castle's essay in the same volume, "Contagious Folly - <i>An Adventure</i> and Its Skeptics," as offering alternatives to "the lesbian eradicating options of credulous versus crazy." Instead, the Castle opens the question, "what kind of <i>act</i> was it...to write <i>and publish</i> this...claim made for a place in public history...of their subjectivities?" In the wake of the Rodney King verdict and the pre-publication assessments of "Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl," Sedgwick seeks to "de-emphasize the epistemology of evidence and instead stress its erotics."
