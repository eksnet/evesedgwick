index-desc: In this chapter from a collection of essays on queer Warhol, Sedgwick locates interconnections between queer shame and blushing; white and translucent skin; race and racism; browness, Hershey’s chocolate and the “Hershey highway;” and ways that the experience of being a queer child can manifest in adulthood. Sedgwick also observes that “the shame-delineated place of identity doesn’t determine the consistency or meaning of that identity, and race, gender, class, sexuality, appearance, and abledness are only a few of the defining social constructions that will crystalize there.”
