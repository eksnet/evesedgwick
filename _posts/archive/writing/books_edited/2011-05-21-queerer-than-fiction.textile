<i>From the introduction to Novel Gazing</i>

<i>Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction</i> came together unprogrammatically.  Invited by the journal <i>Studies in the Novel</i> to edit a special issue, I asked forty or so writers I admire whether they could find room on their agendas to write something  that would, loosely speaking, convene the rubrics "novel" and "queer." I felt more than fortunate in the response, when these startlingly imaginative essays started tumbling in at a rate that soon overfilled the journal -- and didn't slow down even then. 



<i>From the introduction to the special issue</i>

One premise of the present collection is that a closer, more respectful attention to past and present queer reading practices – the kind of attention these essays, in their different ways, all embody – will show how the reservoir of practices already in use crucially exceeds the theorizations of a consensual hermeneutic of suspicion. Many of these essays are, rightly, incisive and unerring in their methodical suspicion; but what more unites them is a very different impulse and history, which would be badly misrecognized under the currently available rubrics.
