"_Fat Art, Thin Art_ is a wrenchingly honest account – or enactment – of a writer’s relation to her gift ... filled with hesitations, self-cancellations, erasures, and gratifying fireworks. The pleasure of _Fat Art, Thin Art_ is witnessing Sedgwick discovering, again and again, the wonders – gorgeous shames and vindications – of what she can say." –??Wayne Koestenbaum??

"Reading _Fat Art, Thin Art_ is a thrilling experience. The publication of these poems will help to complete our picture of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick who, already recognized as one of the most extraordinary critics of her generation, now proves herself one of its truly innovative poets." –??Maud Ellmann??

"This is poetry of a great soul which presents to mind shapely and unmistakable presences brought very close to the eye. _Fat Art, Thin Art_ is a work of poetic distinction and indispensable human use." –??Allen Grossman??
