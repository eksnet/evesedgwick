"For all the power of Sedgwick's paradigms, and for all her finesse as a theoretician, her greatest gift was language itself, which she worked like a baroque, recalcitrant instrument, a bellows she forced to make unaccustomed sounds, pushing critical idioms (the received postures of literary-critical academic writing) into unfamiliar torsions." â€“<i>From the foreword by Wayne Koestenbaum</i>
