"One of the most influential texts in gender studies, men's studies, and gay studies." – <i>Catherine R. Stimpson, New York Times Book Review</i>

"In many ways, the book that turned queer theory from a latent to a manifest discipline." – <i>Voice Literary Supplement</i>

"A crucial force in the emergence of gay and lesbian studies, <i>Between Men</i> provided a set of highly sophisticated intellectual itineraries and conceptual tools for analyzing the psychosocial complexities of male bonding in the British culture of 1750 to 1850." –<i>Stephen Barber and David Clark</i>, from the preface to <i>Regarding Sedgwick</i>
