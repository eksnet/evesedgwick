Containing revised opening and closing chapters, this new edition of _The Coherence of Gothic Conventions_ makes the case that the Gothic in English literature has been marked by a distinctive and highly influential set of ambitions about relations of meaning. Through readings of classic Gothic authors as well as of De Quincey and the Brontes, Sedgwick links the most characteristic thematic content of the Gothic firmly and usably to the genreâ€™s radical claims for representation. A new introduction to this reprint of a 1980 study clarifies the connection between the linguistic or epistemological argument of the Gothic and its epochal crystallization of modern gender and modern homophobia. --_From the jacket copy_
