"In many ways, the book that turned queer theory from a latent to a manifest discipline." – ??Voice Literary Supplement??

"A crucial force in the emergence of gay and lesbian studies, ??Between Men?? provided a set of highly sophisticated intellectual itineraries and conceptual tools for analyzing the psychosocial complexities of male bonding in the British culture of 1750 to 1850." –??Stephen Barber and David Clark, from the preface to??
