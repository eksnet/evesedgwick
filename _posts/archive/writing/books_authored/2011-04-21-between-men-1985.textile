"Sedgwick offers us dazzling illumination of how, in a homophobic world where homosocial desire bonds men together, their desire for each other must be manifested across the body of the woman they both claim to love. We learn what are the dynamics when two men love one woman, a triangle that occurs with surprising frequency in our literature. Clever, shocking, and probably irrefutable, <i>Between Men</i> is wonderfully readable."  â€“<i>Carolyn G. Heilbrun</i>
