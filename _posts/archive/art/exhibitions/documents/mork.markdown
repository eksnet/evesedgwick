h5. In the Bardo: From "Come as You Are" (Unpublished, 1999)

A few months ago, getting a checkup, I mentioned to my oncologist an academic conference on death and dying, and remarked that as far as I could tell from the program, I was the only sick person involved in it. He said, You know, it is a nice philosophical question at this point, in exactly what sense you can be said to be sick. He meant his comment to be cheering, and it actually was--IÃ­m feeling very well, and I liked his acknowledging that.

At the same time, what is harder to explain is the sense of recognition that comes, as Fields put it, with being able to see and say, Ah, this is where I am in this bardo, the one of dying. Fields also noted how others, such as the healthy, who live in different bardos, move perhaps at different speeds, perceive, think, feel perhaps at different frequencies. To say that there seem to be distinctive psychological and spiritual tasks to accomplish in the bardo of dying, for anyone lucky enough to be able to focus and be present to them, is only another way of saying that there are special freedoms to be claimed here: freedoms both of meaning, relation, and memory, yet also from them.
