### Reading Relations in British Fiction: ND, CUNY

This seminar will practise close reading of a sample of British fiction in pursuit of 'reading relations' in several senses, through several intertwined questions.  What have been the implications of focusing realistic fiction so sharply on the desiring intensities of the bourgeois family?  How have the familial 'relations' of realistic fiction been both read by psychoanalytic thought and replicated within it?  How do literacy and reading function as topic and as hermeneutic within these fictions? What forms of relationality get constructed in them--not only among characters, but between the novels themselves and those who read them? How do these reflect or affect the self-relationality of narrators and/or of authors?  We will look for alternatives to normative understandings of sexual, familial, narrative, and self-relationality in a small group of works by Thackeray, Dickens, Charlotte Bronte, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Penelope Fitzgerald.

#### Course requirements:  
All auditors and enrolled students are required to (1) keep up with the reading on a weekly basis, and (2) speak in class at least once every week.  Enrolled students are required to complete a mutually-agreed-on final project, and to consult with me substantively, early, and often about its nature and progress.  
Pending consultation, I am very open to collaborative and/or experimental projects, as well as more conventionally presented ones.  First-year students who obtain my approval early in the semester also have the option of keeping a reading journal (>5 pages per week) instead of undertaking a final project.
