"Cavafy, Proust, and the Queer Little Gods" appears in Panagiotis Roilos’s  "<i>C.P. Cavafy: the Economics of Metonymy</i>":http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/59fce5tr9780252034817.html. In Eve’s words, the piece investigates "the dozens, scores of miscellaneous beings, tutelary spirits, and what seemed like the most conventional, casual French literary invocations of nymphs and dryads. But among them, they actually generate this world that's so filled with life-both internal to characters but also all around them." (From an interview with "Michael Snediker":http://nonoedipal.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/queer-little-gods-interview.pdf. "The Good Anus: Commentary on Guss's 'The Danger of Desire'" in <i>HSGS: Studies in Gender and Sexuality.</i>)
