"Cavafy, Proust, and the Queer Little Gods" appears in Panagiotis Roilos’s  [[<i>C.P. Cavafy: the Economics of Metonymy</i>]]link/ (http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/59fce5tr9780252034817.html /link. In Eve’s words, the piece investigates "the dozens, scores of miscellaneous beings, tutelary spirits, and what seemed like the most conventional, casual French literary invocations of nymphs and dryads. But among them, they actually generate this world that's so filled with life-both internal to characters but also all around them." (From an interview with [[Michael Snediker]]link/ http://nonoedipal.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/queer-little-gods-interview.pdf /link. "The Good Anus: Commentary on Guss's 'The Danger of Desire'" in <i>HSGS: Studies in Gender and Sexuality.</i>)

Jason Edwards delivered a lecture at Yale University for the Material Cultures Study Group, whose 2010-11 academic year theme is "Material Cultures and Interiority." Jason’s lecture, "Interiorising Materiality?: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's Patchwork Panels," focused on Eve’s textile work and developing a new interpretive vocabulary for discussing the intersections of her work in, as she put it, "Fiber, paper, and Proust."

October 1, 2010: For Beauty is a Series of Hypotheses
/posttitle

post/
Author and scholar Eve Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist. In this lecture, scholar Jason Edwards examined a broad range of Sedgwick's art works, as the culminating presentation in a series of seminars on Sedgwick's art. 

To date, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is best known as the author of a series of quickly paradigmatic texts on queer and affect theory, including Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire, Epistemology of the Closet, Tendencies, and Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity. Much less appreciated is the fact that Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist, whose works were shown in exhibitions including Floating Columns/In the Bardo, Bodhisattva Fractal World and Works in Fiber, Paper and Proust. Jason Edwards (Reader in Art History at the University of York and author of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Alfred Gilbert's Aestheticism: Gilbert Amongst Whistler, Wilde, Leighton, Pater, and Burne-Jones) contextualized her artwork in relation to her better-known literary theoretical and other works on paper.

Jason Edwards, who is currently working on a book focused on Eve’s textile art*****, led an intimate series of seminars in Eve’s studio and at the Graduate Center. In-depth discussions focused on Eve’s work in “fiber, paper, and Proust” as well as her bookworks, weavings, and panda calendars. The series of seminars culminated in an opportunity for former students to bring and discuss their own work produced in Eve’s book arts classes.

February 25-26, 2010: Spanking and Poetry conference, CUNY
/posttitle

post/
From the [[call for proposals]]link/ http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/ /link:
"When I was a child the two most rhythmic things that happened to me were spanking and poetry." (<i>Tendencies</i> 182)

Eve Sedgwick lovingly, if none too gently, slapped open the sphincter-tight boundary rings of critical scholarship on the sexual and affective relations between bodies. This conference invites continued play with the tools she created for examination of "all the different surfaces that make a self for most of us, printed pages, 'our' ideas, institutional relations and activism, vibrations of a voice, the gaping abstractions and distractions of creativity, the weird holographic projections of our names and public personae, the visible and impressible extent of the parts of our bodies" (<i>Tendencies 104-05</i>). We welcome paper proposals on any aspect or application of her critical, literary, and artistic work, inviting scholars to broadly consider and reconsider Sedgwick's intersections with and influences upon their fields. In the spirit of her own perversion of academic style, we particularly encourage proposals that expand the boundaries of the conventional conference paper through experimental or creative critical practices. We also seek papers engaging with Sedgwick’s pedagogical practices and proposals, as expressed in her written work or as performed in her classes at The Graduate Center or other institutions.

The Spanking and Poetry conference was nearly canceled due to an unexpected snowstorm that shut down much of the city--including the CUNY Graduate Center, where the conference was to be held. Many incoming flights were delayed or canceled, and keynote speakers Jonathan Goldberg and Michael Moon were unable to get to the city. Thanks to the efforts of the conference’s organizers, Tracy Riley and Margaret Galvan, CUNY agreed to open its doors for an informal plenary session. Around fifty people made their way through the snowy streets to attend a lively and moving series of panels. Attendee and presenter Mia Chen wrote an in-depth review of the conference [[here.]]link/ http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/sequined-beings-are-we/#more-127 /link

October 2009: Honoring Eve symposium at Boston University
/posttitle

post/
Text taken from the [[Honoring Eve website.]]link/ http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/calendar/event.php?id=92477&cid=73 /link

A day of rich intellectual exchange in honor of the memory of Professor Sedgwick, the "soft-spoken queen of gay studies," the "'primum mobile' of queer theory," and one of the most gifted writers of our time.  Eve taught at Boston University in the early 1980s and there are still many there who remember her from those years.  BU hosted many of her old friends and newer fans for a day of remembrance and celebration.

The ID 450 Collective, whose name and genesis was inspired by Eve, began as a study group on published feminist thinking, but when we started writing ourselves-also instigated by Eve-we broadened the subject considerably with our own disparate imaginations and experiences, a project that was simultaneously happening within the feminist movement in the 1980s. But while feminist activists were fighting about differences among us, we were having a lot of fun exploring those differences. When Eve was with us from 1982-84 (plus a bit in 1986-87, 1991, and once in 2008), we staged an all-night meeting discussing our first sexual experience with a human at a Howard Johnson’s motel room in the Fenway; we ordered ID 450 T-shirts and then jackets with "feminist" names such as "Tang" and "Dreamwhip"; we published some of our writings in a lesbian sex magazine called <i>Bad Attitude,</i> which no one mentioned on her vita; we discussed ways to escape binary thinking on Eve's lawn in Amherst (at Eve’s instigation, of course); we cooked and ate sumptuous meals together. After Eve left the group, we wrote autobiographical fragments about our lives for 6 or 7 years, a rich herstorical record of our shared yet different lived experiences as women. When Eve left this world in April, we wrote memorials to her together and formally sent prayers to her in the Bardo, wishing her no pain, and a safe journey to wherever she is resting and playing now.

Videos from the symposium are available [[here.]]link/ http://www.bu.edu/honoringeve/ /link Proceedings from the symposium will be published in a forthcoming issue of <i>Criticism: Quarterly for the Literary Arts.</i>
