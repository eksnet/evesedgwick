h5. September 2010: Jason Edwards seminar series

Jason Edwards, who is currently working on a book focused on Eve’s textile art*****, led an intimate series of seminars in Eve’s studio and at the Graduate Center. In-depth discussions focused on Eve’s work in “fiber, paper, and Proust” as well as her bookworks, weavings, and panda calendars. The series of seminars culminated in an opportunity for former students to bring and discuss their own work produced in Eve’s book arts classes.
