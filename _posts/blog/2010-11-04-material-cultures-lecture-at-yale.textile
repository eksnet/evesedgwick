Jason Edwards delivered a lecture at Yale University for the Material Cultures Study Group, whose 2010-11 academic year theme is "Material Cultures and Interiority." Jason’s lecture, "Interiorising Materiality?: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's Patchwork Panels," focused on Eve’s textile work and developing a new interpretive vocabulary for discussing the intersections of her work in, as she put it, "Fiber, paper, and Proust."
