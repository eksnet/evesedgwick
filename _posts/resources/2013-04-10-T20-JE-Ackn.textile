p(intro). Acknowledgments

<p><i>Tendencies at Twenty </i>was sponsored by the Centre for Modern Studies and the History of Art Department at the University of York. I am grateful to Helen Jacobs for her administrative support; to Carol Mavor, for helping me to chair the plenary panel, and for her characteristically piercing questions; to Hal Sedgwick for making the journey to York, and for all of his kindness; and Sarah McCarry and T Meyerhoff, for all of their hard work on Eveâ€™s behalf, on her archive and website.</p>
