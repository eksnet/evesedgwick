<b>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's <i>Between Men</i> at Thirty: Queer Studies Then and Now</b>
City University of New York, October 23, 2015

<b>Symposium Program and Video Recordings</b>
<i>Scroll down page and click on videos to view the sessions and panel discussion.</i>

Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's landmark book <i>Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire</i> was the focus of an international, interdisciplinary symposium to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its original publication, and the publication of a new 30th Anniversary Edition with a foreword by Wayne Koestenbaum. Presented by The Center for the Humanities, the symposium was organized by Jason Edwards, Joshua Wilner, and H.A. Sedgwick.  

According to the organizers, the conference examines "both the singular impact of Sedgwick's ground-breaking work and its multiple and on-going ramifications." It includes "a series of short papers engaging with the text, its reception, and its relevance to the evolving field of queer studies. Additionally, a panel of editors who have published, and continue to publish, Sedgwick’s writing will discuss working with her and the nature of her authorship as its image or significance changed over the decades."

<i>Hosted by the CUNY Graduate Center in collaboration with the History of Art Department at the University of York, UK.</i>

<i>Co-sponsored by the CUNY Graduate Center’s Advanced Research Collaborative, the CUNY Graduate Center’s Futures Initiative, Guillotine Press, Columbia University Press, and the CUNY Graduate Center’s Ph.D. Program in English.</i>
