"Sedgwick's brilliant _Epistemology of the Closet_ will have many lives: as a work of literary criticism, a cultural study, a political analysis; as a text for gay and straight, academic and non-academic readers, and potentially as a landmark in the development of gay and lesbian studies." –??Julie Abraham, Women's Review of Books??


"Despite all of the talk current now about how 'engaged' or 'activist' literary criticism, no book I have recently read is as successful as Sedgwick's in making provocative connections between literary acts and social dynamics.  –??Mark Edmundson, The Nation??
