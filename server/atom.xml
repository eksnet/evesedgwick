    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This long piece about Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer and final illness has been written over a period of five years, mostly on days that were on or near to Eve&amp;#8217;s birthday, our wedding anniversary, or the day of her death. These were days that I wanted to reserve for reflections about our life together, and writing was a way of helping to focus my thoughts. Also, in the first few years after Eve&amp;#8217;s death, my recollections about her were almost compulsively focused on the time of her illness and death, and it seemed to me that writing down these recollections might be a way, by giving them a more permanent form, to allow my thoughts to move on to earlier, healthier times.  This effort, as well perhaps as other influences, has been largely successful, so that gradually I have become increasingly willing to see this project done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing has not followed the chronological progress of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer. I wrote first, and at greatest length, about the time of Eve&amp;#8217;s final illness. That writing had a greater urgency for me during the first year or two after Eve&amp;#8217;s death, and my recollections then were more detailed than in recent years, during which both my urgency and my memories have gradually been fading. For the most part I have written from memory, but I have made some use of various documents to assist in my recollection of specific facts. I have relied on such assistance most extensively in writing about the last several years leading up to Eve&amp;#8217;s final illness, during which her treatments and their complications became more numerous and the sequence of events more tangled, making it difficult for me to remember them clearly. Some of what I have written is, and can be, known only to myself and so of necessity is, however imperfect it may be, definitive. But much of the factual detail that I give could be checked against other sources; I have no doubt that many errors of detail or understanding would be found, as well as many places where much more extensive information could be given. Eve&amp;#8217;s archives contain several boxes of documents that could contribute to such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first few years of this project, I was writing entirely for myself, with no intention of ever showing it to anyone else. Even now, it is primarily for myself that I am writing. But gradually I have realized that I would include this writing in Eve&amp;#8217;s archive. If the archive is preserved, as I hope that it will be, then this will eventually be available to anyone who wishes to read it.  I expect, though, that the length and specificity of this narrative will sustain the interest of no more than a few readers, and I beg that others will pardon me for writing for myself, and not for them.&lt;/p&gt;

August 24, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;==============&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part I The bottom drops out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1990, Eve was flourishing. She had moved to Duke in the fall of 1988. She had a distinguished chair, a good salary, a moderate teaching load, close friends among the faculty and graduate students, and her own house, shared with her new dear friend Michael Moon, to entertain them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time that Eve and I had not been strapped for cash. We had no savings at all when Eve moved to Duke, and so Eve had to take a short-term loan from Duke for the down payment on her house. Even with her higher salary, paying off that loan, along with all her other expenses, left Eve with about fifteen thousand dollars of increasing debt after her first two years at Duke. In mid-1990, however, I had inherited half the proceeds from the sale of my father&amp;#8217;s house; even after paying off our debts, we had some savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve was becoming well known. &lt;i&gt;Between Men&lt;/i&gt; had been out for several years and &lt;i&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/i&gt; was in press. Because of her writing and because of the prominence of the English department that Stanley Fish was creating at Duke, she was receiving national attention and was speaking frequently at colleges around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve was also increasingly active politically, compelled by the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; crisis and the appalling response to it. This response was especially salient in North Carolina, where the hateful Jesse Helms continued to be the dominant political voice. Engaged at a national level through her writing, her speaking, and her increasing participation in the governance structure of the Modern Language Association, Eve was also engaged locally, joining with some of her students in the activities of the local branch of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt;-UP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve seemed at last to have a position commensurate with her talents and her energies, to have the freedom and resources to pursue the goals of greatest importance to her, and to fully appreciate &amp;#8212; and be making the most of &amp;#8212; these opportunities. She was forty years old, apparently with her most productive period &amp;#8212; possibly decades long &amp;#8212; still ahead of her. What is so shocking to me, looking back, is how very brief &amp;#8212; just a few months &amp;#8212; this period was for Eve, and for me.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would take a six-month sabbatical, spending the fall quarter of 1990 in Durham with Eve. I had a writing project for that time, but my main motive for being in Durham was to have the time to spend with Eve, to help with getting settled in the new house, to get acquainted with the place, and to get to know Eve&amp;#8217;s new friends and her life with them. After almost twenty years in a commuting relationship, these few months of living together were very special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the second half of my sabbatical, beginning right at the turn of the year, I went to Australia, to spend two months living in Sydney and doing research with my friend and colleague Barbara Gillam. Eve and I had been scrupulous, in our commuting, to spend almost every weekend together, taking turns doing the traveling. So this trip to Australia was by far our longest separation since we had first started living together. I don&amp;#8217;t remember now, but I imagine that the security and comfort of Eve&amp;#8217;s position made this absence feel more possible for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My visit to Australia went well, but it ended badly. I had planned to leave Sydney toward the end of February and to spend several days in New Zealand on my way home. Then, a week or so before my planned departure, I heard from Eve that she had found a lump in her breast, that it was feared to be cancer, and that she was to have a biopsy soon to examine it. I canceled the New Zealand trip and returned directly to the US and to Durham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumps in her breasts, and even a biopsy, were not new to Eve. I wish I remembered her medical history better, but I think she had found a lump when she was living in Ithaca, during her post-doctoral fellowship, and had a biopsy done in the local hospital there. Then later she had found another lump and had a biopsy done by a highly respected breast cancer surgeon at Columbia Presbyterian in New York City. His name was Dr. Habif and I remember his claim to Eve and me that he had a tactile memory for the breasts of the women he had examined and on that basis alone could detect changes when he reexamined them months later. I don&amp;#8217;t remember how Eve was referred to him but she did see him several times. We found him reassuring. There was also a lump on her thyroid gland (on her throat) which he biopsied at one time. None of these biopsies found any cancer. Eve went to Dr. Habif for follow-up exams for some time but then he retired and she ceased to have regular follow-ups as far as I remember. I do remember that Eve did regular self exams of her breasts, that she was told that her breasts were naturally lumpy, and that (as is generally the case with younger woman) her breast tissue was dense so that detecting and imaging lumps was difficult. So when Eve told me, in Australia, that there was another lump in her breast, I hoped that it would again be benign. But Eve made it clear that both she and her doctor at Duke did not expect that outcome. They were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve&amp;#8217;s medical oncologist at Duke was Eric Winer. Her surgical oncologist was George Leight. Her biopsy showed that her tumor was malignant, and the imaging showed that it was large. As was more common at that time (I don&amp;#8217;t know in her particular case if things would be different now), Dr. Leight performed a radical mastectomy, removing all of her right breast and all of the lymph nodes from the right armpit, several of which were also found to be cancerous. The size of the tumor and its spread to several of the lymph nodes made her prognosis more negative than it otherwise would have been. Eve did not have radiation following her surgery. She did have six months of chemotherapy, delivered intravenously at (if I remember correctly) monthly intervals. The breast cancer itself produced no symptoms but the symptoms of the chemotherapy were severe. The standard treatment at the time, which Eve received, was referred to as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CAF&lt;/span&gt;, which is the initials for three chemotherapy drugs: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil. All of these are poisons, the first related to mustard gas, the second capable of producing life-threatening heart damage, and the third an agent that kills cells by interfering with their metabolism. Because the cancer consists of growing cells, it is somewhat more susceptible than normal cells to damage by these agents. Treatment thus aims to find a balance that does lethal damage to the cancer while doing more tolerable damage to normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve lost all her hair, which was psychologically very traumatic. Her hair was long and red and very beautiful; it was a vital part of her self-image. She bought a wig &amp;#8212; a good one, but not good enough. It didn&amp;#8217;t look natural. She said it made her feel like an Hasidic woman. She didn&amp;#8217;t wear the wig but wasn&amp;#8217;t comfortable being bald socially, so she collected and wore a large number of varied and beautiful head coverings. It took, as far as I remember, years for her hair to grow back, and it was never the same, was always thinner and lighter than previously. She tended during her years at Duke to keep it short, and she experimented with having it dyed (a bleached blond, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy was also physically debilitating. It extended roughly from March to August, and I remember being with her on a visit in Ithaca the following October when even a short walk through one of the gorges was physically exhausting. It&amp;#8217;s hard to remember now the time course over which her strength recovered. Not long after that (I think it was the 1991-92 academic year, but it may have been the following one), Eve had a year-long fellowship at the National Center for the Humanities, located in the Research Triangle industrial park between Durham and Raleigh.  During that time, she joined a gym near the Center and worked out there on a regular basis for some months. They had sophisticated training machines that measured her strength and adjusted their demands accordingly, so that her strength increased gradually. Eve became muscular. It was a one-time experience, a deliberate and successful effort to counter the debilitating effects of chemotherapy. I took a series of photos of Eve in muscle-building poses and she made a calendar using them and gave copies to some of her friends. It was symbolic, I guess, of life going on, of making the best of it. Eve always said, as I recall, that she was not particularly attached to life, but I think she was ambitious to make, and to continue to make, the most of her talents, of whatever talents were left to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve felt diminished cognitively by her cancer treatment. Again, I don&amp;#8217;t remember the time course of this at all well. But she became keenly interested in the research on &amp;#8216;chemobrain&amp;#8217; as it developed over the years and felt that her own earlier impressions were vindicated by this research. The community of women who had had chemotherapy talked about its cognitive effects long before these effects were at all well accepted by the medical community. This is presumably because the measures used by the research community were far too crude. Eve was in no way cognitively debilitated (as she was, for a while, physically debilitated). She was enormously smart, had a tremendously high IQ (measured in high school at about 175 I think she told me, although of course IQ is itself far too crude a measure to capture or characterize Eve&amp;#8217;s dazzling creative talents) and so had plenty of IQ points to spare. I saw no diminution of her abilities and I&amp;#8217;m not aware that others did either. But Eve did. She spoke particularly about her &amp;#8220;word hoard&amp;#8221; and about how it was less easily available to her than it had been. I&amp;#8217;m terribly conflicted about how to regard this. On the one hand Eve did so much wonderful work in the almost two decades following her chemotherapy &amp;#8212; wonderful writing, wonderful teaching, wonderful art; I don&amp;#8217;t want to think or say anything that might seem to diminish those extraordinary accomplishments. On the other hand, it feels so awful to me, so tragic, that someone with Eve&amp;#8217;s very exceptional talents, with the ambition to make the most of them, and with the worldly circumstances that gave her exceptional freedom to do so, should at such an early age (she was 41) have been made to feel this loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biopsy of Eve&amp;#8217;s tumor, following her surgery, found it to be estrogen receptor positive (ER+), which is a common type of breast cancer tumor. The finding is interpreted to mean that the tumor&amp;#8217;s growth is stimulated by the hormone estrogen. This &amp;#8216;fact&amp;#8217; guided Eve&amp;#8217;s therapy for many years. Eve&amp;#8217;s treatment, following her chemotherapy, consisted in taking a daily oral dose of a chemical called tamoxifen, which was thought to partially block the effects of the estrogen and so to starve the cancer of something that it needed in order to grow. Tamoxifen had shown effectiveness in clinical trials for periods of up to five years, following which it&amp;#8217;s good effects appeared to diminish or even reverse. So Eve was set on a five-year course of tamoxifen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the side effects of chemotherapy is to induce menopause (usually, although not always, permanently), which itself diminishes the levels of circulating estrogen. This combined with the further effects of the tamoxifen can produce even more marked menopausal symptoms.  Eve was plagued by hot flashes. Having always been made uncomfortable by heat, these frequent hot flashes were very unpleasant for her. She sought various ways of diminishing them, but not, as far as I remember, very successfully. Apart from that, though, I don&amp;#8217;t remember other serious side effects of the tamoxifen treatment. As Eve recovered from the effects of her chemotherapy she recovered something like her normal health, as far as I recall, apart from the side effects I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned. She was certainly very active during this time at Duke, teaching, writing, joining in political protest, taking on various administrative roles (such as with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt;) and traveling widely and frequently to lecture on her work. This period lasted almost five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years has sometimes been conventionally regarded as an important milestone following treatment of breast (and other) cancer. Although it&amp;#8217;s well known that treated cancer can recur ten, fifteen, twenty years after treatment, most recurrences occur within five years, so that when five years is reached without recurrence there is guarded optimism that the cancer has been cured &amp;#8212; eliminated from the body &amp;#8212; by the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years also being the established duration of treatment for tamoxifen, and no further treatments having, at that time, been established as having additional benefit, if Eve had completed five years of tamoxifen she most likely would have ceased to have any treatment at all. Then the cancer and its treatment would no longer have been part of daily life and concern about it could perhaps have receded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve didn&amp;#8217;t quite reach that point. I don&amp;#8217;t remember just when she started taking tamoxifen, but I believe she was given a few months to recover from chemotherapy first, so she started it sometime in the late fall of 1991. It was at the very end of August, 1996, that Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer was found to have recurred, having spread to her spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the spread of the cancer had begun at some time before it was discovered, perhaps had begun even before her initial treatment. But even when she began to have symptoms it took some months before they were correctly understood. She began having neck and back pains in the late spring of 1996 but her primary care physician at Duke unaccountably did not think of the possibility of metastatic cancer. Instead, Eve was prescribed physical therapy, whose manipulations might have had &amp;#8212; but fortunately did not have &amp;#8212; disastrous effects on her weakened spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me learning of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer recurrence was sudden, unexpected, and one of the worst moments I experienced during her illness or during my life. I can&amp;#8217;t remember if I knew that she had plans for imaging; I probably did, but if so they would have been to investigate her back pains, which we had not been led to think of as being related to her cancer. I flew down to Durham, as planned, on the Friday evening of the Labor Day weekend but instead of being greeted at the airport by Eve, as I had expected, I was met by our dear friend Mandy, who was then a graduate student, and Eve&amp;#8217;s niece Rosie, who at the time was staying with Eve. They told me that the imaging had shown that Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer had metastasized to her spine. This meant, as I knew, that her life expectancy was now only two or three years, more or less.  There was nothing to say or do; I remember having the feeling of the bottom having dropped out of everything; I remember being quiet, too emotional to speak, and crying a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physicians who saw the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; images had been alarmed at the weakened condition of Eve&amp;#8217;s upper spine. They were afraid that a vertebra of the spine might fracture, impinging on the spinal cord and causing permanent paraplegia. I don&amp;#8217;t remember the exact timing, but as I recall Eve was immediately given a temporary neck brace to wear and was told not to drive or do anything strenuous. Within a few days she was fitted with an elaborate neck brace that went over her shoulders and her breast bone. She wore this uncomfortable device throughout the day for months (I can&amp;#8217;t remember now just how long) and was also limited in her sleeping positions during the night. During the time that she wore this brace she decorated it with polymer clay figures that she had made. I still have it, in her archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of her immediate treatment was a course of radiation to the affected area of her spine. This was begun very soon, but I don&amp;#8217;t remember now quite how it was coordinated with Hurricane Fran, which came through Durham a few days later and left most of the town (including Eve&amp;#8217;s house) without power for a week. Her radiation oncologist at Duke told us that although the radiation was technically labeled as palliative, because metastatic cancer could not be cured, he was giving her a dose strong enough to be associated with curative treatment, his reasoning being that Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer appeared to be slow in developing (indolent) and so he wanted the effects of the radiation treatment to protect that area of the spine as long as possible. This was a wise decision and may have contributed substantially to the length of time that Eve was able to live following the diagnosis of her metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radiation treatment was five days a week, extending over several weeks (probably six, but I don&amp;#8217;t now remember for sure). The radiation center was set up to be efficient so that patients coming daily didn&amp;#8217;t have to spend very long there each day, generally well under an hour as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve was not warned that this radiation to the upper spine, including that at the back of her neck, would burn, like a sunburn, her esophagus, so she was more alarmed when this symptom appeared than she would have been had she been warned to expect it. This burn made it painful for her to eat, especially anything that wasn&amp;#8217;t soft. So for some weeks she limited herself to beverages and soft foods (I remember Jon Goldberg making pureed carrots for her).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the radiation was to kill (or greatly retard) the cancer in that area, which it seems to have done, but it could not of itself restore the bone, which had to regrow. This regrowth was a slow process and very difficult to assess because even when bone has regrown it doesn&amp;#8217;t look normal to imaging. So for the rest of her life, Eve lived with a persistent uncertainty about how weak her spine was, about what strains it might or might not withstand. There was a fear (or terror), for example, every time the vehicle she was riding in was jolted or went over a bump that it might fracture her spine and leave her paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Eve&amp;#8217;s radiation treatment, Eric Winer recommended having no systemic treatment. His reasoning, as he explained it, was that the cancer had been accustomed to the low level of estrogen produced by the tamoxifen and so might be impeded by the sudden withdrawal of the tamoxifen. Eve thus went for about a year, from the fall of 1996 to the fall of 1997, without treatment. As with all of Eve&amp;#8217;s treatments over the years, there is no way of assessing retrospectively whether Eve might have done better, in the long run, with a different approach to her treatment; there is no basis for comparison. Perhaps the lack of tamoxifen did impede the cancer for a while. But in a year, in October of 1997, it was found to have progressed again and to have invaded another, lower portion of her spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Eric Winer had left Duke for Harvard, where he went on to become one of the most eminent clinical breast oncologists in the country, heading a highly significant clinical trial. Eve and he continued to be in touch. They had grown close during the years he was monitoring her treatment, and we turned to him again later for his advice. Eve&amp;#8217;s treatment was taken over by another clinical oncologist at Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric&amp;#8217;s leaving Duke made it easier for Eve to leave too. The situation in the English Department had become somewhat less attractive to her; Stanley Fish, who had brought Eve to Duke, was no longer chair, and a more conservative spirit was becoming more assertive in the department. But principally, Eve and I had agreed that after living a commuting life for about twenty-five years it was time for us to live at least in the same town if not the same abode. I looked into the possibility of coming to Duke and Eve investigated the possibility of coming to New York City. Although Duke did make me an offer, it was not a very attractive one. In New York, on the other hand, Eve&amp;#8217;s inquiries had produced a very positive response, through the mediation of our dear friend Josh Wilner, from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;). Eve had moved rapidly. In the fall semester of 1997, she was still living in Durham but was on leave from Duke, trying out &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; by commuting to New York weekly to teach a seminar at the Graduate Center even while the making of a formal offer was still in process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formal offer from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; came through and Eve accepted it. We made some necessary repairs on her house, packed a few things to take, gave away other things, and arranged for an auctioneer to come in and sell the rest of Eve&amp;#8217;s possessions &amp;#8212; her car, furniture, large art pottery, and so forth &amp;#8212; after Eve had left. She formally took up her position at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; as of January 1, 1998, moving up to New York City in the first part of that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had not yet sold her house when she left Durham. She needed time to do that and also to look around and decide where she wanted to live in New York. My own studio apartment there (on 11th Street just east of 5th Avenue) is very small, so there was no question of us both living there. We decided that I would keep my apartment and that Eve would find her own place nearby. That way we could maintain the independence of our commuting years but without the commute.  Eve found an equally small apartment at the old Fifth Avenue Hotel, then converted into rental units, on 5th Avenue and 10th Street. She lived there for a year and a few months before moving to a somewhat larger studio apartment that we bought on 16th Street just west of 5th Avenue, where she stayed for the remainder of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progression of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer had been discovered when Eve&amp;#8217;s move to New York City was little more than two months away, so we and her oncologists agreed that she would wait and begin radiation treatment to the affected part of her spine in New York after she had moved there. Unlike Durham, where there was no question of being treated anywhere other than the highly respected Duke Hospital, New York City had many options; so our first task was to decide where and by whom she would be treated. On the advice of Eric Winer, Eve made an appointment to see Dr. T. at Memorial Sloan Kettering (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;). The choice of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; was obvious, given its reputation for cancer treatment; with Dr. T., who was a relatively young physician, I don&amp;#8217;t remember why she was recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part II Ups and downs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experience with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; and Dr. T was mixed. She seemed to be a dedicated physician &amp;#8212; she had a cold when she first saw Eve but was carrying on anyway &amp;#8212; and she had a big smile and a friendly manner. But she always seemed rushed &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t remember her ever once sitting down &amp;#8212; and her friendliness was impersonal. She never addressed Eve by name (first or last), never expressed the slightest interest in her as a person or seemed to know the slightest thing about her beyond her &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; medical record. We were inclined to assume that she remembered Eve from one visit to the next, but we had no evidence of it. And she was &amp;#8216;by the book&amp;#8217;. She was young and showed little sign of clinical judgment based on her own experience in her approach to treatment. I remember a couple of indications of that, one of which I&amp;#8217;ll save until later. The other came from a comparison we made between her and Erik Winer. He had said to Eve that her cancer appeared to him to be indolent and that in spite of the statistics he expected her to be around for quite a while. This of course was somewhat reassuring (and, as it turned out, correct). We tried this remark out on Dr. T, who replied rather brusquely that cancer could change quickly; then she quoted the statistics to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; was difficult too. They trusted no one but themselves, so every image or test result that we brought to them from Duke had to be repeated in their facility. This caution was in some ways impressive but it slowed things down. And they were not well run at that time (although when we returned years later they were in some ways improved). Every appointment involved long waits, sometimes for hours. And their handling of patient billing issues was both inept and aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve was treated at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; for about six months. She had a series of radiation treatments to the portion of her spine (somewhat lower down) to which the cancer had spread. Also, after her cancer progression had been detected at Duke, Eve had begun to take, as a daily pill, a medicine called arimidex, which was a relatively new treatment that also aimed, like tamoxifen, at suppressing the effects of estrogen, but which worked through a different biochemical mechanism than tamoxifen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should perhaps insert here that there is a vast armament of more or less ineffective treatments for metastatic breast cancer. The standard clinical procedure is to begin with what seems most promising (in terms of broad patient characteristics such as being ER+, the statistical efficacy of the treatment, and its likely side effects). The idea is to maximize the chance of temporarily slowing or halting the spread of the cancer, while minimizing the severity of the treatment&amp;#8217;s potential side effects. When that treatment is found to no longer be working (some never work at all) or its side effects become intolerable, that treatment is stopped and a new treatment is tried. These decisions are based on statistics and clinical experience, but (at that time at least) it is impossible to predict how an individual patient will respond to any particular treatment. These successive treatments are called the first-line treatment, the second-line treatment, and so on. A patient can move through through three or four or five or even more treatments, but the general finding is that successive treatments are less and less effective, for reasons that are not well understood, so that eventually the patient runs out of options even though there may still be many treatments she has not yet tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cancers, including breast cancer, have what are called tumor markers, which are biochemicals that circulate in the blood and give some indication, although an imprecise one, of the metabolic activity of the cancer. Monthly measurement of her tumor markers was one of the main ways that the effectiveness of Eve&amp;#8217;s treatment could be assessed. When she started treatment at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, Eve&amp;#8217;s markers were elevated, and during the first month or two at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; the arimidex did not lower them. When we next saw Dr. T., she said that it appeared that the arimidex was not working; she seemed ready to abandon it and move on to the next treatment. I was reluctant to do so. Arimidex sounded so promising and Eve had not been taking it very long. Also, Eve&amp;#8217;s hot flashes, which for some time had not been bothering her as much, had quite recently gotten substantially worse, and I took this as an early sign that the Arimidex was beginning to kick in, suppressing her estrogen levels. (One might think that it would be helpful to measure a patient&amp;#8217;s estrogen levels directly, but this was never done, perhaps because the available clinical tests were too crude to be useful in differentiating the patient&amp;#8217;s already low estrogen levels from the extremely low levels that effective arimidex would produce). We waited another month, and Eve&amp;#8217;s tumor markers began to go down. As it turned out, the arimidex was the most effective treatment that Eve had; it worked well for over six years. This is the other example of our lack of confidence in Dr. T.&amp;#8217;s clinical judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve&amp;#8217;s first six months in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; also brought the beginnings of her involvement with alternative, or complementary, forms of treatment. Following Eve&amp;#8217;s radiation treatment, she developed a problem with walking. She could walk, but after a few blocks it became very painful for her to continue. One of the strengths of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; is its army of specialists. Any complaint that a patient has may lead to a referral to the appropriate specialist. So Eve&amp;#8217;s back was imaged and examined by a specialist (I no longer remember the details) and no problem was detected; yet her difficulty with walking remained. It was both frustrating and ironic that this problem appeared just at the time when, after decades of living in places in which she went everywhere by car, Eve had moved to the quintessential pedestrian city, offering so much to someone who could enjoy a long walk &amp;#8212; and so little to someone who could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took Eve to see my osteopath. I had been referred to Dr. Steven Weiss by Laverne who had in turn been referred to him by her somewhat unconventional physician (a doctor given to inviting select groups of his patients over to his apartment for discussions of political, philosophical and other weighty issues). Osteopathy had its start in the 19th century as a more holistically oriented alternative to conventional medicine. But over the decades osteopathy, in its desire for greater respectability as a profession, had moved closer and closer to conventional medicine, so that most doctors of osteopathy (DOs) practicing today are hard to distinguish from MDs. But a few retain their allegiance to the holistic roots of their discipline; Dr. Weiss is one of the few. His genius is in diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven asked Eve to walk back and forth a few times in his examining room. After watching her, he told Eve that, although he couldn&amp;#8217;t rule out the possibility that the cancer was contributing to her problem, he could see a non-cancer issue related to her problem with walking. Then he invited Eve to come and sit on his lap. This startled both of us, but Eve gingerly complied and he proceeded to gently jiggle her up and down for a few minutes. He then asked her to try walking again, and she found that the pain was gone. Although Eve may have had additional followup treatments with him (I&amp;#8217;m not sure), her difficulty with walking was gone following that initial jiggle, and it didn&amp;#8217;t come back &amp;#8212; this being the closest thing to a miracle cure that I have ever witnessed. Steven explained that the problem had arisen from something to do with the sciatic nerve, which winds around the hip somehow and runs down into the legs, and that he had released it from its difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve returned to Steven several times over the years, for various problems, and he was generally helpful, but toward the end of her life the issues associated with the growth of the tumor adjacent to her spine became predominant and Steven told her that he could no longer offer her more than very temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it was someone at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; it may have been Dr. T. &amp;#8212; who referred Eve to Dr. Raymond Chang. We had asked about the possibility of enhancing her treatment with some form of complementary medical treatment. Dr. Chang had practiced for a while at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; and then had left to establish his own private practice. He was trained in conventional Western medicine but seeks in his practice to combine that approach with techniques from traditional Chinese medicine (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TCM&lt;/span&gt;). His practice is evidence-based, focusing on treatments for which there is some promising evidence in the scientific literature but not enough to meet the standards of conventional medicine. He sometimes uses prescription medicines for off-label purposes but more often uses supplements; he looks for treatments with minimal side effects so that (I imagine) even if they don&amp;#8217;t turn out to be helpful, at least they won&amp;#8217;t be harmful. He is expensive, and doesn&amp;#8217;t accept insurance, but Eve and I had good luck in being reimbursed for his treatment (as we did with Dr. Weiss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve saw Dr. Chang regularly thereafter until, in the last month or so of her life, mobility issues prevented her from going to his office. He would look at her records, discuss her current situation, and offer recommendations on supplements to take. He often gave us a perspective on specific issues that differed from, and usefully complemented, the ones we were getting from her conventional physicians. He is pragmatic in limiting how many supplements he recommends, but Eve tolerated taking pills well and took 50 or more a day (the count varied) spaced out over breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime. I took care of keeping her supplied and making up daily pill boxes with the pills divided by time of day. (Dr. Chang also recommended a powered Chinese mushroom that needed to be mixed into a warm beverage, such as tea, but it was somewhat bitter and Eve never took to it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Dr. Chang adjusted his recommendations, both as Eve&amp;#8217;s condition changed and as the balance of evidence shifted. It&amp;#8217;s impossible to know, with only a single patient, whether any of his recommendations were helpful or not. Eve did live for much longer than statistically predicted, however, and I&amp;#8217;m inclined to think that he did help; but I have no idea how much he helped. He&amp;#8217;s an intelligent, well-informed, and thoughtful practitioner, though, so we probably did as well with him as we would have done with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had started being seen at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; shortly after she arrived in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;, at the beginning of 1998. By the time summer arrived she wanted to move on. I was hesitant to leave &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, because of its excellent reputation, but Eve didn&amp;#8217;t want to continue with them or Dr. T. any longer. She had gotten a recommendation for an oncologist named Alan Astrow, who was practicing at a new cancer center associated with St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s Hospital in Greenwich Village, so we went to interview him. We had a long conversation with him and his nurse; I don&amp;#8217;t remember the details, but we liked them both and were impressed with the set-up of the cancer center (which was run by a medical corporation separate from St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s). So, late in the summer Eve said goodbye to Dr. T. and shifted the responsibility for her care to Dr. Astrow. (Her excuse to Dr. T. &amp;#8212; and part of her actual motive for moving &amp;#8212; was that the St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s center on 15th Street was only a short walk from her Chelsea apartment and so was much more convenient for her than &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; on the Upper East Side.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had a good, long run with Dr. Astrow. As I&amp;#8217;ve said, the Arimidex, which she started before she left &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, worked well for years. So for a long time Dr. Astrow was seeing her and looking at her tumor markers periodically, but not needing to change her treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Eve started seeing Dr. Astrow, and for some years thereafter, it was his practice to also order periodic bone scans of Eve. These were basically, as I understand it, full-body x-rays. Their purpose was to look for new sites of metastatic cancer, primarily in the bones. Their weakness was that they would light up to any kind of insult to the bone, so they were given to false positives. Eventually these were dropped (at least by Dr. Astrow and perhaps by the field more generally); Dr. Astrow concluded that if the cancer did spread this would be detected by the pain it caused as readily as by the bone scan. I mention the bone scans primarily because Eve was fascinated by the images they produced. We kept them (I have them still), and she used these ghostly images of herself beautifully in some of her art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these were good years, compared with what followed, they were not without problems. I mention a couple of these here from memory and am sure more could be found by searching through Eve&amp;#8217;s old medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time Eve developed an ulcer, which may have been caused or exacerbated by a couple of her supplements. The ulcer was treated and healed, and Dr. Chang stopped the suspected supplements, both of which had reasonably compelling evidence for their inhibiting effects on cancer. As with the side effects of conventional treatment, this illustrates the double bind that often grips a cancer patient: treatments that appear to be somewhat effective against the cancer may be too toxic in other ways to be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this double bind came with a supplementary treatment that Eve had started at Duke when her cancer progression was detected in late 1997.  This is also a good example of how treatment strategies can change over time as evidence about their effects accumulates. There is a class of drugs called bisphosphonates that are used to strengthen bones in osteoporosis. But evidence was emerging that they also had a protective effect against the spread of cancer to the bones. So once a month for many years Eve walked over to the 15th street cancer center to spend a few hours getting an IV drip of bisphosphonates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, around 2005, an oral surgeon on Long Island published a disturbing article reporting a number of cases, among patients having long-term treatment with bisphosphonates, of a particularly nasty condition known as osteonecrosis, in which the lower jaw and its associated teeth begin to crumble and disintegrate. This was alarming to Eve, as it would be to anyone, but more so to her because she had a serious phobia about dentists and dental problems (deriving from a childhood spent getting cheap dental care from dental school students). The article, recognizing their potential usefulness, did not recommend against bisphosphonates for cancer patients, but it did recommended caution. Dr. Astrow cut back the dose, and Eve began watching closely for any signs of incipient osteonecrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2006, Eve eventually did detect a suspicious sign. We rented a car and drove out to Long Island to confer with the surgeon who had discovered the problem. He confirmed incipient osteonecrosis. He treated the immediate problem but left to Dr. Astrow the decision about what to do with Eve&amp;#8217;s bisphosphonate treatment; Astow, and Eve, decided to discontinue it. The osteonecrosis eventually healed. Eve was left, however, without the anti-cancer help of the bisphosphonates. How much this loss contributed to the eventual fatal spread of the cancer in her spine is unknowable, but it seems probable to me that it did contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly before Eve died, the medical consensus, at least at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, was that a lower, and much less frequent, dose of bisphosphonates could still have some effect against cancer to the bone while being much less likely to stimulate osteonecrosis. Eve was scheduled to begin this new treatment and would have done so had she lived. (Incidentally, one thing I have successfully prevented myself from doing &amp;#8212; so far at least &amp;#8212; is to scan the literature looking for improvements in breast cancer treatment, and then to dwell with regret on the thought that such improvements were not available to Eve. I&amp;#8217;m confident that treatments will eventually improve significantly &amp;#8212; and I&amp;#8217;ll be very glad when they do &amp;#8212; but I try to accept that Eve and I had no choice but to do our best with what was available to us at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a patient is regularly receiving IVs over an extended period, it&amp;#8217;s common to surgically implant a device, called a &amp;#8216;port&amp;#8217; that has a tube going into a vein and an opening, just beneath the skin, into which a needle can be inserted. This allows the IV to be given without the nurse or technician having to find and access a vein every time. This can be particularly useful with cancer patients because chemotherapy tends to be destructive to the veins, making them narrower, more brittle, and more difficult and painful to access. Eve had such a port implanted in her arm when she was initially doing chemotherapy at Duke. Her treatment at that time was intended to be curative, and the port was removed after her treatment was completed. Then, years later, after the cancer had metastasized and she was again having regular IV infusions for a variety of reasons, including the bisphosphonates, she had a port implanted in her chest. Accessing the port was a special skill that only some nurses had training in and that even those nurses were not equally good at. So it sometimes required several tries. Some places provided a numbing cream that could be put on the skin in advance. Ports could wear out or become permanently blocked and non-functional, so we were always somewhat anxious when the second or third attempt was unsuccessful; sometimes another, more expert nurse would be summoned. But Eve&amp;#8217;s port never failed, although occasionally a long anxious effort was needed before it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem was when a nurse or technician did not want to use the port. This did not happen at the treatment center where Eve went for her regular IV, but it did happen on multiple occasions when we were someplace else where they wanted to draw blood or do an injection (as is required, for example, in some imaging techniques). Sometimes the person was not trained in how to access ports and no one with training was handy; sometimes the person was confident that they just didn&amp;#8217;t need to use the port (which required special equipment that might have required a special effort to locate). But in fact it was almost impossible to access Eve&amp;#8217;s vein&amp;#8217;s directly. They were small to start with, they were unusually deep below the surface of her arm; and they had been permanently damaged by chemotherapy. So these efforts resulted in a lot of rummaging around with the needle, first in one arm, and when that was unsuccessful, in the other arm, leaving both arms bruised and sore for days after. This of course was very painful to Eve and because it was also unnecessary and futile, she hated and dreaded it. Increasingly we resisted these attempts and eventually came to refuse them entirely. This led to multiple encounters of varying degrees of unpleasantness. But the patient has the right to refuse treatment, and this is what Eve said she would do, if necessary. As far as I remember, she never was denied treatment for this reason; when it came down to it, someone was found to access her port. But these emotionally painful struggles are among the worst aspects of what I remember of Eve&amp;#8217;s care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime not too long after Eve moved to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;, we became involved with Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt;, which is a project of The National Breast Cancer Coalition (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NBCC&lt;/span&gt;). The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NBCC&lt;/span&gt; is an advocacy group that emphasizes lobbying for government spending on breast cancer research, evidence-based detection and treatment programs, and the active participation of patient advocates in the government policy making and funding process. The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NBCC&lt;/span&gt; set up Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; to give advocates more background in the science of breast cancer research so that they can better understand and participate in discussions of patient concerns about research developments and funding decisions. Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; offers a five-day residential crash course in the fundamentals of the science behind breast cancer research and treatment. This isn&amp;#8217;t much time, of course, but it does get advocates started and gives them more confidence to join in the discussion. Chapters of Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; graduates exist in various places around the country, including in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;; they meet regularly to discuss new research papers, hear talks by researchers, and debate policy issues. They attend scientific meetings both to learn about new research and to present the patient point of view; their members are sometimes invited to participate in government hearings or to join panels that are making decisions about the government funding of breast cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; course is offered several times a year in various parts of the country. Admission requires an application, but the program is free to those who are accepted. I don&amp;#8217;t remember how we found out about Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt;, but one summer, when their course was being offered in Westchester county, we applied and were accepted. Eve and I enjoyed the course, worked hard at the material, and felt well-initiated into the group. After that we both regularly attended chapter meetings for several years. We also went to the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference, which is the principal annual meeting devoted exclusively to breast cancer research. Also, toward the end of this period, Eve volunteered to be a patient advocate on the panel of a government funding agency in California. She read a stack of applications and flew out to California for several days to participate in the panel&amp;#8217;s discussions and decisions. That experience, however, left Eve dissatisfied. She felt that the level of knowledge she had gained was inadequate to allow her to make sufficiently informed judgments. It may be that the gradual deterioration in her health also contributed, but she became less regular in attending the Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; meetings. She continued to follow their forum online, however, and maintained a high respect and admiration for the contributions made by several of the members, who devoted a great deal of time to Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; and had attained an impressive level of understanding of the issues. I continued to go to the Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; meetings until shortly before Eve&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve&amp;#8217;s other foray into patient advocacy was an advice column that she wrote for a year or more for Mamm, a magazine for women with breast cancer (modeled on Poz &amp;#8212; a magazine for people with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;). It may have been through Project &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LEAD&lt;/span&gt; that Eve met the editor of the magazine and was offered this job. She approached it with relish, but there weren&amp;#8217;t many letters requesting advice. So Eve would first think of a topic on which she felt that she had good advice to give and then herself write the letter requesting her advice (a common practice of advice columnists, according to what I&amp;#8217;ve been told). Her columns are witty but also serious, offering valuable advice. I&amp;#8217;d like to see them gathered together and published someday, since they are no longer available through Mamm, which appears to have ceased publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; Held / Dropped&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-1998 Eve had completed her radiation treatment at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; and knew that the arimidex appeared to be stabilizing her cancer. The following six years, although far from trouble free, were a relatively good time for her health. Her cancer treatment, although daily, was a routine that consumed relatively little time and left her feeling reasonably well. She took her many pills four times a day, walked over to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVCCC&lt;/span&gt; for her bisphosphonate infusion once a month, and also had regular blood tests, bone scans (in the first few years), checkups with Dr. Astrow and consultations with Dr. Chang. I remember that toward the end of this period, Dr. Chang became so enthusiastic during one appointment about the stability of Eve&amp;#8217;s condition that he suggested that perhaps the combination of mainstream and complementary treatment had succeeded in eradicating the cancer from her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By March of 2004, it had been almost eight years since the metastasis of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer had been detected. When it was first detected, and then within a year spread further, Eve expected to live for only two or three more years. During those first few years there was an urgency about Eve&amp;#8217;s explorations of Buddhism, her artwork, and her writing. As the arimidex continued to be effective, however, it is my impression that Eve&amp;#8217;s view of her illness shifted somewhat. Neither she nor I were convinced by Dr. Chang&amp;#8217;s brief optimism, but how long Eve might live came to seem more uncertain, the time of her death more indefinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time, in 1996, that the metastasis of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer was first detected, the first signs of hope in the treatment of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; were beginning to appear. During the next few years, &amp;#8220;cocktails&amp;#8221; of multiple drugs were gradually adopted and improved, and data accumulated showing that the lives of patients who had access to these cocktails could be prolonged, in some cases, for many years. This transformative development in the treatment of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; also effected Eve&amp;#8217;s thinking about her own disease. With new cancer treatments continually under development, it was possible to hope that if one treatment failed, another possibly better treatment might be available to take its place. Although, as with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;, the mainstream thinking continued to be that metastatic cancer was not curable, it began to seem possible that it might be contained almost indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far Eve&amp;#8217;s thinking may have sometimes gone in this direction I don&amp;#8217;t know. At the beginning of 2004 her own cancer and its treatment entered a new  phase, one of ups and downs, of successive new treatments sometimes bringing improving health until they began to fail, of cycles of slow improvement and slow decline punctuated by sudden physical failures requiring urgent treatment, of a continual balancing of the potential good effects of treatment with its sometimes barely tolerable side effects, and of many attempts to control those side effects with ancillary treatments, each having their own side effects. This irregular, unpredictable rhythm of ups and downs continued for nearly five years. We might almost have been tempted to think, sometimes, that it might go on indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects of Eve&amp;#8217;s life during this period were constrained to follow this irregular rhythm. When Eve was doing well she worked more energetically on her art and her writing, she traveled and gave talks, and just for pleasure augmented these trips or took other trips. From the time of her cancer&amp;#8217;s metastasis, however,I had not been comfortable with Eve&amp;#8217;s making trips out of town by herself; I wanted to be on hand if difficulties arose and so almost always went with her on her trips. Also, I increasingly worried about her traveling to less developed countries, where the available health care might be of questionable quality, and of making very long trips, such as on our previous flights to Asia. Thus during this period our travel was mostly to Europe or within the United States. Even so, sometimes Eve had to cancel planned trips or talks because of downturns in her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve remained physically active, but even before 2004 those activities had gradually become more limited. Eve had taken up weaving in Durham and had purchased a large professional loom, which she brought to her small rented apartment in New York, but she gave up weaving not too long after that because of the strain that it placed on her back. Likewise, although she began learning to turn pots on a wheel, she gave it up because of the back strain. During the first years of the period beginning in 2004, Eve was often very active for prolonged periods with somewhat less demanding but nevertheless quite physical art-making activities. During the last year or so of her life, however, even these activities became more sporadic and she was able to produce little art. Eve&amp;#8217;s ability to get around town on her own also narrowed. Our long neighborhood walks became shorter and less frequent, although she continued to make the 10-minute walk between her apartment and mine and continued occasionally to walk out to do a little shopping or to meet friends at local restaurants. She stopped taking the subway because of their many flights of stairs but continued to take the bus along familiar routes, such as to and from her office. Increasingly we turned to taxies, and then to private cars which could be scheduled and would come directly to Eve&amp;#8217;s address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some core activities continued throughout this period. Every week, during the academic year, Eve held her &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; office hours and gave her two-hour evening seminar. I can only recall three occasions, up to the time of her death, when Eve&amp;#8217;s physical condition forced Eve to miss a meeting of her seminar. Eve continued, too, to keep up an active social life, seeing friends at her apartment or  sometimes at local restaurants, although she had a preference for the Manhattan luxury of being able to &amp;#8216;order in&amp;#8217; from almost any of the local restaurants that she liked. Also, until she was confined to her bed during the last couple of weeks of her life, Eve spent many hours of every day at her computer. Sometimes she was working on her writing or teaching preparation, but she also carried on an extensive correspondence, regularly followed several blogs and mailing lists, did most of her shopping, managed her finances, speculated on the stock market, and for hours at a time played games such as computer solitaire. She spoke of playing these games both as a meditative activity and as times in which she often did productive thinking about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chang&amp;#8217;s optimistic speculation about Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer having been eradicated, made at an appointment in early January 2004, was ill-timed. At the end of that January, at a checkup with Dr. Astrow, Eve told him that she was having pain at the back and side of her neck when she swallowed. He ordered a bone scan for her and then an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;. Both showed progression of her cancer to additional vertebrae in her spine. In mid-March, when she met again with Dr. Astrow to review the results of the imaging, he recommended that she stop taking arimidex and try a new treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Astrow recommended one treatment. We went to Boston to see Dr. Winer, who recommended another. We decided to follow Dr. Winer&amp;#8217;s suggestion, which Dr. Astrow also accepted although he said it would not have been his first choice. It was an experimental treatment that had a logical if somewhat counterintuitive argument in its favor. The idea was that because the cancer had presumably adapted itself to a bodily environment with very little estrogen, the cancer would be unable to tolerate high doses of estrogen. There was some laboratory evidence that supported this idea and it seemed plausible to us. Eve started taking high-dose estrogen in April. We made several trips to Boston for follow-ups with Dr. Winer. At first everything seemed to be going OK, but then in late June, Eve suddenly developed a sharp pain in her groin. Imaging showed that the cancer had spread in Eve&amp;#8217;s spine and also to the bones of her hip and pelvis; it was probable that a hairline fracture there was causing the pain in her groin; her neck was also very painful. (From this time on, controlling Eve&amp;#8217;s bone pain became a regular part of her treatment, although the amounts of her pain medications varied over time.) It seemed that the high-dose estrogen had accelerated the spread of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was feared that stopping the estrogen all at once would be too great a jolt to Eve&amp;#8217;s system, so it was gradually tapered off. Then she begin a new treatment &amp;#8212; a monthly injection of faslodex, another agent that worked against estrogen in yet a different way. Eve also had a course of 12 sessions of daily radiation to her left hip in an attempt at local control of the cancer that had attacked there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faslodex had a good effect. Eve&amp;#8217;s tumor markers, which had risen, dropped again, and repeated imaging showed some improvement by the middle of November. Eve&amp;#8217;s faslodex treatment stabilized her cancer for about 17 months, which extended through all of 2005, although during the last few months of that year her tumor markers were creeping gradually upward. Midway through this period Eve began also taking a new anti-cancer medication, called femara, which had shown promise when combined with faslodex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing the symptoms caused by Eve&amp;#8217; cancer and by its treatment required increasing attention. It was during this year that she had the ulcer that I mentioned earlier; it cleared up with treatment and after she stopped taking the supplement that was presumed to be an irritant to her stomach, but anti-ulcer medication became another pill that she took for the rest of her life. The narcotics Eve was now taking to control bone pain tended to make her feel drowsy and dull-witted, so we were continually juggling the amount of her pain medication, decreasing it to as low a level as she could tolerate, then increasing it as necessary. Eve began to have frequent headaches. A brain &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; fortunately showed no tumor activity there, so it seemed most likely that the headaches were a by-product of tension brought on by the pain in her neck. Dr. Chang prescribed a muscle relaxant that helped with the headaches but it too produced drowsiness; Eve usually took it at bedtime. Dr. Chang also suggested an experimental off-label treatment using a drug called noscapine;  it would not be covered by insurance and would be expensive, but we nevertheless decided to try it; it could be taken concurrently with the faslodex and femara, and might have an anti-cancer effect independent of theirs. Eve began taking noscapine right at the end of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had high blood pressure, which was being treated by Dr. Goldstein, who was her primary care physician. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how Eve initially found Dr. Goldstein, but I think he was recommended by Dr. Astrow (they were both affiliated with St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s). As Eve&amp;#8217;s blood pressure medicine was increased, Eve began to experience episodes of faintness due perhaps to a combination of lowered blood pressure with low blood counts produced in part by her ulcer and perhaps in part by some of her other medications. Given the feared instability of her spine, it was urgent that she not fall, so avoiding too much faintness was very important. Finding just the right dosage of blood pressure medication, or medications, became another balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, which was a year of relative stability in Eve&amp;#8217;s basic cancer treatment, I see in my notes records of about fifty medical appointments, for injections, infusions, imaging, and meetings with the half a dozen or so different physicians whom she saw regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2005, Dr. Astrow told us that he had accepted an offer to head the oncology program at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. We had heard that St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s Hospital was not doing well financially, but didn&amp;#8217;t know if that had affected Dr. Astrow&amp;#8217;s decision to go elsewhere. We considered following him to Brooklyn but decided against it because it would have been a long subway commute for us, whereas the St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s cancer center was only a short walk. There were two remaining medical oncologists there, one of whom was Dr. Roger Waltzman, to whom Eve transferred her care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2006, what had been foreshadowed by Eve&amp;#8217;s rising tumor counts was confirmed by imaging. Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer had spread again in her bone and now also showed multiple metastases in her liver. Eve discontinued faslodex, and after consulting with both Dr. Waltzman and Dr. Winer, she began treatment with xeloda at the end of January. Unlike her previous several treatments, xeloda was not concerned primarily with estrogen. Instead, it was converted internally into an agent related to flourouracil (the &amp;#8220;F&amp;#8221; in Eve&amp;#8217;s earlier &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CAF&lt;/span&gt; chemotherapy), which acted to slow the growth of tumor tissue. An advantage of xeloda was that it was taken at home as a once-a-day pill rather than as a monthly injection at the treatment center. Unfortunately, the effects of noscapine could interact unpredictably with the effects of xeloda, so on Dr. Chang&amp;#8217;s advice, Eve discontinued the noscapine that she had only recently begun to take; we were never able to assess whether it would have helped her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because xeloda is a cell-killing agent, its use has to be carefully balanced so that it kills enough cancer cells while not killing too many normal cells. Thus it is usually taken daily for two weeks followed by a one-week break in order to give normal cells a chance to recover. Before starting the next cycle blood tests are done to make sure that sufficient recovery has occurred. Eve started out to follow that routine, but completed only one cycle of treatment before it had to be interrupted because of another, urgent development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two principle treatments for cancer such as Eve&amp;#8217;s are chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There are some important differences between them that I should perhaps note here. Chemotherapy is systemic; it circulates through and affects the whole body. This is essential in treating metastatic cancer because the cancer cells themselves can also spread throughout the body and take root anywhere (although different kinds of cancer are more likely to settle in some places than others). Because chemotherapy affects the whole body, it must be limited to effects that healthy tissue throughout the body can tolerate. Radiation therapy, on the other hand, is local. It&amp;#8217;s effect, broadly, is always the same, which is to kill both normal and cancerous cells, although cancer cells can sometimes be especially susceptible to it. In part because the effects of radiation therapy are more predictable across individuals than those of many chemotherapies, and in part because radiation therapy is local and so can be more intense, radiation therapy is often more predictably and quickly effective than chemotherapy in slowing or halting the growth of cancer in some delimited region. Another difference, however, is that most agents used in chemotherapy are metabolically washed out of the body within days or weeks, but the effects of radiation on tissue are cumulative over many years; this means that when an area of the body has once received a full course of radiation therapy, it cannot be radiated again, except perhaps after many years, without the danger of having a disastrous effect on normal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences between chemotherapy and radiation therapy became central for Eve now, at the beginning of 2006, because imaging (as well as Eve&amp;#8217;s pain) showed that the cancer was beginning to show some resurgence in the area of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine, in the region of her neck, to which it had originally spread and where it had originally been treated, in 1996, with radiation therapy. Eve was continuing to travel to Boston to consult with Dr. Winer, as well as being seen by Dr. Waltzman in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;. At the beginning of February, we traveled to Boston again so that Eve could have imaging of her neck done at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, where Dr. Winer practiced; Eve also met with two radiation oncologists  there. The conclusion was that Eve would try another course of radiation to her cervical (neck) spine, where it had previously been radiated, but that this would be done with a highly technical new form of radiation treatment, called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMRT&lt;/span&gt;) and available at only a few specialized centers, including Brigham and Women&amp;#8217;s, which is the hospital associated with Dana Farber. The essence of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMRT&lt;/span&gt; was that the radiation beam was carefully shaped, based on imagery of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine, which was interpreted by a computer program and used to position a beam of radiation that moved around during each radiation session, varying the intensity of its beam as it moved, in a pattern precisely specified by the computer. The goal was to irradiate the bone of the spinal column while avoiding delivering any more radiation to the spinal cord that ran within the hollow tube of the spinal column. The danger was that additional radiation to the spinal cord itself could cause tissue damage there, possibly leading to permanent quadriplegia. The complexity of this treatment was such that it required several weeks for the treatment planning and computer programming to be done by a highly specialized radiation oncologist (Dr. Ramakrishna, who modestly likened the delicacy and art of his work to that of Michelangelo painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel). The treatment itself would require daily sessions for a month. While that treatment was being planned, Eve was to begin a somewhat longer course of conventional radiation therapy to her collarbone; this course of conventional treatment would then continue concurrently with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IMRT&lt;/span&gt; so that would both be completed at about the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire course of treatment required Eve to spend almost two months in Boston. We looked into various options, and Eve settled on renting a room about a twenty-minute walk, uphill, from the hospital. Eve moved there with some books and her computer in mid February and stayed until early April, receiving almost daily radiation therapy. The spring semester was already underway at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;, and remarkably, Eve continued to teach her Tuesday evening seminars there throughout the course of her treatment. Dr. Ramakrishna agreed that Eve could have four sessions a week instead of the usual five (radiation is never given on the weekend). Every Tuesday, skipping radiation, Eve would take the train to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;, have her office hour and teach her seminar, spend the night at her apartment, and then take an early Wednesday morning train to Boston, arriving in time for her afternoon session of radiation. Fortunately, although Eve had significant bone pain at that time, her physical strength and energy were reasonably good, and they improved considerably during her weeks of walking up and down the hill between the hospital and her room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because xeloda, like radiation, kills cells, combining their effects was considered dangerous, so in mid-February, after completing only one cycle of xeloda treatment, Eve had to suspend that chemotherapy until a couple of weeks after she finished radiation therapy. This was necessary, but the tradeoff was that she was denied any systemic treatment of her cancer, which was active in many other parts of her body, for about two months. This was a difficult tradeoff that was to recur in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in mid-April of 2006 Eve had her 2nd cycle of treatment with xeloda. It was still too early to know if it was helping. Eve began a third cycle of treatment in the second week of May, but it had to be discontinued due to another event, unexpected and to me deeply disturbing. I had made some fairly detailed handwritten notes during and shortly after this event; I&amp;#8217;ve transcribed them and am including them here verbatim (only very lightly edited) because they are more detailed and accurate than what I could write now and also because they give some flavor of our lives at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s Hospital, May 2006&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[This is a transcript of 4 pages of notes written by has; pages 1 &amp;amp; 2 are dated 5/14/06.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday 5/12/06:&lt;/b&gt; I slept at [my studio], got up early, &amp;amp; gave 3 lectures @ &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SUNY&lt;/span&gt; from 9 am to 11:50am. Eve met me downstairs at 11:50 (she took the bus uptown) and we went up to the 6th floor for her appt (noon) w. Scott Richter. He didn&amp;#8217;t see any eye disease (glaucoma etc) and did not see any ptosis (lid droop). He also said that although the pupils are different sizes this can be normal &amp;#8211; he didn&amp;#8217;t see any problem w. the contraction of either pupil &amp;#8211; Thus he thinks that Eve does not have Horner&amp;#8217;s Syndrome. He said that she does need new glasses. We need to measure her reading distance and her computer viewing distance and decide what combination of lenses she wants (progressives, reading glasses, etc.) and let him know &amp;#8211; then  he&amp;#8217;ll write a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we took a taxi to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CPS&lt;/span&gt; (Central Park South &amp;amp; 7th ave) for Eve&amp;#8217;s 2 pm apt w her dentist &amp;#8212; cleaning &amp;amp; checkup &amp;#8212; which went OK. About 3-3:15 we caught a taxi, which took me back to 42nd St. &amp;amp; took Eve home. Eve called me from her studio around 3:30 pm to say that there was a message from Grant about scheduling her visit to B&amp;amp;W [Brigham &amp;amp; Women&amp;#8217;s] &amp;#8212; the dates he was proposing don&amp;#8217;t work for me so I need to call him on Monday about the visit. I stayed at work until 6 then went out for dinner w BG [Barbara Gillam] (at Adkeniz on 46th) and then to see Sweeney Todd. After the theater BG &amp;amp; I took the subway down to 14th St.; I walked BG to the Larchmont &amp;amp; then walked up to Eve&amp;#8217;s place, arriving about 11 pm &amp;#8211; 11:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived Eve was sound asleep &amp;#8211; I got ready for bed w/o waking her up. I then woke her up as I started to get into bed. She was surprised to see me. She said she&amp;#8217;d gone to sleep right after calling me at 3:30 and had basically slept through until 11:30 when I woke her. But she said she had woken occasionally during that period and had been confused about the day and the time of day &amp;#8211; she thought she had slept through until morning she said. She also said she had spoken with Mike during that period. I looked and found that she had not taken her dinner or bedtime pills. She sat up, got something to eat from the fridge, had her pills, and then we talked about a Nina Simone song she&amp;#8217;d been thinking about &amp;amp; we listened to it. Eve seemed alert &amp;amp; OK. She said she wanted to sit up at her computer for awhile. I went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday 5/13/06&lt;/b&gt; (Saturday morning)&lt;br /&gt;
Between 4 am and 5am I woke up. Eve had come back to bed. She sat up on the side of the bed (or was sitting up) as though she were going to pee, but after a minute or so she lay back down again. I asked her if she was OK. She said &amp;#8216;yes I&amp;#8217;m fine&amp;#8217; or some such. Then after a few minutes she sat up again. We walked to the bathroom where, after a long delay she peed a little, intermittently. I walked her back to the bed. I don&amp;#8217;t remember the details now, but somehow I became concerned that she was not being normally alert and responsive. So I tried to get her to wake up &amp;amp; talk to me, but this was pretty unsuccessful &amp;#8211; she remained groggy &amp;#8211; only half awake &amp;#8211; and would only reply in short simple sentences. I had her sit up in the recliner, thinking that being upright might help, but it didn&amp;#8217;t help very much if at all. While this was going on she said she was having difficulty breathing. It didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be obstructed or fast &amp;#8212; rather it was slow &amp;#8212; she would exhale and then there would be a pause sometimes of a few seconds before she inhaled. When I asked her to, she could breathe more deeply. Because of her mental condition and the difficulty breathing I asked her if we shouldn&amp;#8217;t call 911; she agreed, and I did. An ambulance came pretty quickly (10 &amp;#8211; 15 min) The 2 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; people seemed quite competent &amp;#8211; they checked her out and took her (us) to the St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve was in the emergency room until 3 pm. She had a chest x-ray, blood work, and a CT-scan. No obvious problem, such as a blood clot, was found. Around 3 pm she was moved to a private room (630) on Smith 6. She had visits from 2 residents, Dr Krishna and Dr. [K.], and later in the evening, from Dr. Georgia Lee (&amp;#8216;George&amp;#8217;) who works w. Paul Goldstein (or covers for him on weekends). During the evening Eve&amp;#8217;s condition improved. I went out from 6 to 9 pm to retrieve my briefcase from the College, take a shower etc &amp;amp; pack for the hospital at [my studio], and feed etc. Eve&amp;#8217;s cat and pick up some things for her from [her apartment]. When I got back Eve was much more alert and articulate &amp;#8211; more like herself. They brought a recliner for me and we went to bed around 12:30 am or 1 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[pages 3-4 of my notes, transcribed below, are dated 5/15/06]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday May 14.&lt;/b&gt; Sunday morning we were awakened early by pills, breakfast etc. Eve&amp;#8217;s condition had worsened considerably. She was less responsive, dozed off when left to herself, and appeared to be significantly confused and aphasic. Be the late afternoon she had improved and by evening was considerably more alert and articulate although somewhat confused and inaccurate in her memories of the days events. We had a brief visit midday from Dr. Rugelov who said he was covering for Roger Waltzman. After announcing &amp;#8216;So, you&amp;#8217;re feeling better&amp;#8217; (she wasn&amp;#8217;t), he told Eve that the ventricles of her brain were somewhat enlarged on yesterdays CT scan and that might mean that her cancer had spread to the meninges. He said that an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; of the brain had been ordered for Monday. Somewhat later, Dr Martin covering for Dr. MacAluso, came in and stayed quite a while (she was quite chatty). She had come by earlier while Eve was in the bathroom and had asked for a catheter to be inserted into her bladder to find out if she was retaining urine (her urination had improved substantially by Sat evening but was worse again on Sun morning &amp;#8211; with a long delay before it started &amp;#8211; 2 or 3 minutes &amp;#8211; and then intermittent flow with spurts lasting several seconds each.). A nurse (Eileen) inserted the catheter about 1/2 hour after Eve urinated and drained about 300 ml of urine which was just above the criterion (250 ml?) for deciding to keep the catheter in because she was not completely emptying her bladder when she urinated. Dr. Martin said that Dr. [K.] had called someone (who??) in Boston on Saturday who said that the ventricles in a previous &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; done there looked normal, so Dr. [K.] had concluded that they had expanded since then and were not merely unusually large all along (as some people&amp;#8217;s are). Dr. Martin said that urinary retention as well as Eve&amp;#8217;s confusion etc. could be caused by the ventricular expansion. She also said this expansion could be caused by meningeal cancer obstructing the foramina through which the ventricles normally drain. When I asked for any alternative explanation she said it could also be an infection (meningitis?). She said that in addition to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; Eve should also have a spinal tap (from Dr. MacAluso) to see what&amp;#8217;s circulating in the spinal fluid. From 4 pm to 7 pm I went out &amp;#8211; I went to [my studio] to shower &amp;amp; change, to check my mail &amp;amp; email, &amp;amp; to write emails to TF and to my class, canceling my Monday lecture &amp;amp; quiz. Than I went to Eve&amp;#8217;s studio to check her mail &amp;amp; feed the cat. When I returned Eve told me that someone (Dr Lee?) had stopped by to see her and had told Eve that she thought that the problem was only an infection. Eve talked to her brother and her parents on the phone and sounded, mostly, like herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday May 15.&lt;/b&gt; Woken by the nurse at 5:45 am, Eve was feeling alert and asked for her computer. We got it set up and she read her blogs and the newspaper online for several hours, taking a break to eat some rice crispies &amp;amp; 1/2 a container of milk &amp;amp; ~1/4 of a roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[This is the end of my notes from 2006.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking in the folder labeled &amp;#8220;St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s Hospital May 2006&amp;#8221;, I find in addition to the above notes, a handwritten list, somewhat torn away along one edge, evidently written by Eve, of items for me to pick up when I left the hospital between 6 and 9 pm on Saturday May 13. Eve is evidently pretty alert at this point, although her handwriting looks somewhat jerky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the hospital discharge instructions, which show that Eve was discharged on May 17 (Wednesday). I see now, and remember noting then, that the discharge instructions are very sketchy and are almost entirely inaccurate in describing Eve&amp;#8217;s initial symptoms (high fever [no!], chest pain [no!], unusual bleeding [no!], respiratory distress [OK] [and no mention at all of the mental confusion or difficulty urinating]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s some more from memory about this event. Eve had the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; at St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s and the person who read it (prompted most likely by the expectations of those who ordered the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;) saw evidence that the cancer had indeed spread to the meninges (the lining of the brain). This would have been very serious (and perhaps would have called for radiation of Eve&amp;#8217;s entire brain) but fortunately it was completely wrong. Not too much later Eve and I went to Boston to have an appointment with Eric Winer (planning for it is mentioned in the above notes) and the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; was either repeated or reread or both at Dana Farber / Brigham and Women&amp;#8217;s. They saw no sign of cancer of the meninges (and in the years that followed it was clear that indeed there was none). We were of course very relieved by this, but the false diagnoses at St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s caused us a great deal of unnecessary distress. The overall effect of Eve&amp;#8217;s stay at St Vincent&amp;#8217;s (the sketchiness of some of the doctors, the wildly wrong discharge papers, the seriously wrong reading of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;) combined to convince us to avoid that hospital in the future if at all possible (and as far as I recall we did succeed in avoiding it). This did not affect our confidence in Dr. Goldstein, whom Eve continued to see, or in the St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s cancer center, which, as I have noted, was run separately from St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s hospital. As I recall, however, Eve&amp;#8217;s private room there was quite pleasant, in an old-fashioned way, with a very nice view (as I write this, the hospital &amp;#8212; the only one for a large quadrant of Manhattan &amp;#8212; has been torn down and upscale condos are being built, advertising the view).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember this event as being, initially, terrifying to me. I feared that quite suddenly and entirely unexpectedly, between going to sleep and waking up, I had lost Eve, possibly forever, as someone with whom I could meaningfully communicate. This was a foreshadowing of the time, almost three years later, when I lost Eve again in this way, again temporarily, only a few weeks before her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about the stability of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine, originating at the time when the cancer&amp;#8217;s metastasis to her spine was first detected, had never gone away, and now with the increasing damage to her spine, this concern was intensifying. But the stability of the bone that had been affected by cancer, even if it had partially regrown, was difficult to assess. Our repeated attempts to get a clear answer about the danger of a catastrophic break, which could damage or sever Eve&amp;#8217;s spinal cord, elicited vague and sometimes conflicting replies. There was a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women&amp;#8217;s, Dr. Mitch Harris, who was spoken of so highly by the other doctors there that it amounted almost to awe. He was correspondingly difficult to get an appointment with. Toward the end of May 2006 we returned to Boston to meet with him. We hoped to learn something more definite about the risk to Eve&amp;#8217;s spine, and about what could be done to reduce it. Dr. Harris had clearly prepared for the appointment. He had studied the images of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine and had prepared a detailed plan of how to stabilize it surgically. The plan involved a system of metal bars that he would surgically attach to the bones of the most endangered portion of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine. He showed us images of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine and of other spines to which he had attached similar structures. The technique was very impressive and clear. Unfortunately, the effects the surgery would have were less clear. He thought the structure would hold but because of the difficulty in assessing the stability of the bone he couldn&amp;#8217;t be sure; if there were insufficient firm places to attach the structure then it might fail to hold. Also, the neurological effects were difficult to predict. The immediate aftereffect of the surgery would be serious pain, felt in the areas served by the nerves that would inevitably be somewhat impinged on by the surgery. Usually the pain would diminish with time, but he couldn&amp;#8217;t definitely assure us of that; it might not. We asked what would happen if Eve didn&amp;#8217;t have the surgery; how likely was it that a catastrophic break would occur? He declined to answer this question; he didn&amp;#8217;t know. Overall, this appointment was unsettling. We accepted that he was a highly skilled surgeon and would do as good a job as possible, and we were grateful that he was honest with us, but the necessity of the surgery remained unclear, and there was a distinct possibility that it might leave Eve feeling much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had also been given a strong recommendation (from Dr. Waltzman, as well as I remember) for a neurosurgeon named Dr. Mark Bilsky at Memorial Sloan Kettering (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;) in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;. In mid-June we went to see Dr. Bilsky for a second opinion about Eve having spinal neurosurgery. Our experience with Dr. Bilsky was very different from that with Dr. Harris. Whereas Dr. Harris had impressed us as absorbed in the technical planning of the surgery, with an engineer-like focus on its details, he had seemed somewhat unengaged with the personal effects of the surgery, and detached from the question of whether or not to have it at all. With Dr. Bilsky we never got to the technical planning. He had reviewed Eve&amp;#8217;s images and medical records, and he talked to her about her symptoms, her activity level, how she was feeling, and so on. I don&amp;#8217;t remember all the details of the conversation, but I remember that I (and we) liked him, that he seemed to be paying attention to Eve as a person and trying to look at the entirety of her situation, and I remember most particularly and clearly his conclusion. &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re too well,&amp;#8221; he said to Eve, &amp;#8220;for neurosurgery.&amp;#8221; Although he couldn&amp;#8217;t rule out the possibility of a spinal break, especially if Eve were to have some kind of accident, he seemed to believe that in the normal course of events, given Eve&amp;#8217;s present condition, such an event would be unlikely. This was a great relief to us both. Eve continued to have regular imaging, to meet with Dr. Bilsky, and to be reassured by him for another two and a half years. She never did have the kind of catastophic break in her spine that she had so feared. And I believe that Dr. Bilsky continued to give her considerable relief from the anxiety about it that she had felt for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after her discharge from St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s in mid-May 2006, Eve restarted her third cycle of treatment with xeloda. She then continued having a cycle of xeloda treatment every three or four weeks for more than a year. Xeloda was clearly being significantly effective against Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer. Her tumor markers returned to normal levels and imaging showed that the metastases in her liver were shrinking. Beginning with the relief that came from Eve&amp;#8217;s first appointment with Dr. Bilsky in mid-June, the remainder of 2006 seems, at least in retrospect, more routine. Eve continued to have regular imaging of various kinds, to meet regularly with her doctors, and to have a variety of symptoms and side effects that required management, but her cancer appeared once again to be under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of 2006, Dr. Waltzman, whom we both liked and respected, told us that he too was leaving St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s, moving into a research position in private industry. So once again we needed to find an oncologist, and a hospital. There was one breast cancer specialist remaining at the St. Vincent cancer center, so Eve could have continued to be treated there, but we had somewhat mixed reports about that oncologist, and we were reluctant, after the experiences of the year just past, to maintain an arrangement in which, if the need for hospitalization were to recur, that hospital would be St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s. After consulting with Dr. Waltzman, and with Dr. Winer, we decided that the time had come to give &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; another chance. Eve was already seeing Dr. Bilsky there, so it made sense to us to consolidate her treatment there. We talked extensively with Dr. Winer about the choice of an oncologist from among the many at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;. Because we were continuing to consult regularly with Dr. Winer, we decided with his gentle encouragement, not to select one of the two most well-known oncologists there. Instead we took his recommendation of Dr. Maura Dickler, a relatively junior doctor whom Dr. Winer knew well and with whom he suggested it would be easier for him to coordinate Eve&amp;#8217;s care. At the end of 2006, Dr. Waltzman left St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s and Eve transferred her care back to Memorial Sloan Kettering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve continued to take xeloda for the first half of 2007. Again, the double bind created by treatment side effects appeared. The side effect of xeloda that was most troubling for Eve was peripheral neuropathy. It manifested as both a numbness and a painful tingling, to some extent in her hands but more strongly in the soles of her feet, making walking painful and also, because of the numbness, more difficult and dangerous. In an effort to control the neuropathy, Dr. Dickler repeatedly reduced the amount of xeloda Eve was taking. The xeloda had been remarkably effective in controlling and even turning back (in the case of the more easily measured liver metastases) Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer, but now her tumor markers began to rise again. Was this because the effectiveness of the xeloda had run its course or because the reduced dosage was less effective? There was no way of knowing, but the possibility that an effective treatment might be becoming unavailable to Eve because of its side effects was painfully frustrating to me. At one point I persuaded Dr. Dickler to try increasing the dosage again, but the brief experiment was unsuccessful. In June, scans of Eve&amp;#8217;s liver showed that the tumors there were growing and multiplying again. A new treatment was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dr. Dickler&amp;#8217;s advice, we decided on a combination of vinorelbine and avastin. vinorelbine is thought to inhibit the growth of cancer by inhibiting the processes of cell division. Avastin was at that time a new drug, only recently approved by the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt;, whose intent was to starve the cancer by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels. It was hoped that avastin would increase the effectiveness of the vinorelbine. Avastin was tremendously expensive, approximately $10,000 per bi-weekly dose, so that special approval was needed from the insurance company. As with all of Eve&amp;#8217;s medical treatments, however, almost all of the cost was eventually covered by the combination of her and my medical insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve went to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; cancer center weekly to receive an IV dose of vinorelbine, combined bi-weekly with avastin. The most critical side effect of vinorelbine, however, was that its inhibition of cell growth also affects the body&amp;#8217;s ability to regenerate white blood cells, which are an essential component of the immune system. So on every weekly visit to the cancer center, before Eve could be treated, her blood was drawn and her white blood cell (wbc) count was measured.  If the wbc count was too low, then her immune system was considered to be dangerously compromised and she was not given the vinorelbine. Vinorelbine also affects the red blood cells (rbc) and can produce anemia if the rbc count is too low. After several months Eve began to also receive epoetin with her treatment. This is a drug that acts to increase rbc levels; it can also cause potentially fatal strokes, however, so has to be used with caution. At the end of 2007, after missing several vinorelbine treatments because of low wbc counts, Eve began taking neupogen, which was intended to increase the wbc, although its effectiveness was uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve continued with this treatment for about 9 months. Although not as dramatically effective as the xeloda had first been, the treatment was moderately effective for much of that time. Eve&amp;#8217;s tumor markers were stabilized for a while but then began to gradually rise. Imaging showed that the cancer in her bones appeared to remain approximately stable, but toward the end of this period the disease in her liver began to progress again. Dr Dickler said that it was time to try a new treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of 2008, Eve began treatment with exemestane. Like avastin, exemestane acted to suppress estrogen levels. Eve had stopped taking avastin because its estrogen suppression had lost its effectiveness against the cancer. Several years had now passed, and the idea, as far as I recall, was that suppressing estrogen might over time have recovered some of its effectiveness against the cancer. Also, exemestane acted by a somewhat different mechanism than avastin, so the cancer might be less adapted to its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effects of exemestane were relatively mild, and it had the advantage of being taken orally and so did not require the weekly visits to the cancer treatment center. The effects of the exemestane were not dramatic. As I have said earlier, it is a typical pattern in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that successive treatments tend to be decreasingly effective. Although the exemestane may have somewhat slowed the progression of Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer, her tumor markers continued to gradually rise and scans in late July showed some slow progression in her liver and bone disease. The decision was made, however, to continue the treatment for another couple of months and then to do further scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionally, Eve&amp;#8217;s health remained moderately good during the period extending through 2007 to near the end of the summer of 2008. Her peripheral neuropathy had abated although it had not gone away altogether. Her osteonecrosis had gradually cleared up. Her blood pressure was marginally under control. Her energy level was diminished but not incapacitatingly. One indication of Eve&amp;#8217;s health can be seen in our travel during that period. In addition to short domestic trips, such as several trips to Bethesda to visit Eve&amp;#8217;s parents, during 2007 we travelled to Seville in May, to London in June, and to London and York in October. In 2008 we travelled to Amsterdam and Leiden in April, and to Bordeaux in June. On each of those trips Eve gave one or more talks based on recently written papers. We also vacationed, taking a barge trip in the south of France as part of our October 2007 trip, spending a week with Eve&amp;#8217;s brother and his family on Edisto Island in South Carolina in January 2008, and spending several days at a chateau in the wine country as part of our trip to Bordeaux. I recall that on our trip to Bordeaux we had to change planes in Paris; we were late getting into Paris and had to walk about a mile through the airport, at a fairly fast pace, in order to catch our connecting flight; I was impressed then that Eve could manage that walk (although it was a challenge for her; on the return trip, we requested a wheelchair to help her make that long trip through the airport). In July, 2008, we drove to Amherst to take part in amateur theatricals there (Eve created the program for the performance); that was the last trip that we took for Eve&amp;#8217;s work or purely for pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the summer in 2008, the gradual progression of the cancer in Eve&amp;#8217;s bones became more painfully and disruptively symptomatic. During August, pain in Eve&amp;#8217;s shoulder and hip worsened. After numerous consultations at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, Eve began two courses of radiation treatment. The first, for which the radiation oncologist was Dr. Kaled Alektiar, was a course of standard radiation; it consisted of 10 daily sessions of radiation to Eve&amp;#8217;s hip to attack the cancer there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second course of radiation was more complex, the pain in Eve&amp;#8217;s shoulder arose from recurrent cancer in the part of Eve&amp;#8217;s spine that had been treated with radiation at Duke. Because of the need for great caution in re-radiating that area, the use of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IGRT&lt;/span&gt; (image guided radiation therapy) was once again indicated. This treatment was now available at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, under the supervision of Dr. Josh Yamada. Unfortunately, there was an almost six-week delay before &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; obtained an okay for this treatment from the insurance company and further delays as Dr. Yamada then did his treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These delays were intensely frustrating because imaging in September had shown that the exemestane was no longer being effective. Dr. Dickler recommended that Eve switch to a more aggressive form of systemic chemotherapy, but Eve was not able to begin this chemotherapy until she had completed her radiation treatment. Thus she was left without any effective systemic treatment for several months while her cancer was progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of November 2008, Eve began treatment with abraxane, a new and very expensive drug that was intended to disrupt the cellular growth processes of the cancer. Evidence for abraxane&amp;#8217;s effectiveness, relative to its risks, was limited, and it had only been approved for use in metastatic breast cancer that did not respond to other forms of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospectively, there is not much reason to think that the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IGRT&lt;/span&gt; was effective. Because it was re-radiation, it had been planned very conservatively, to avoid the danger of impinging on the spinal cord; as a result it may have had little effect on the cancer tumors that were beginning to impinge on the spinal canal. Likewise, the abraxane proved to be ineffectual. During the ten weeks or so that Eve was being treated with it, her tumors markers continued to rise, reaching levels far above what we had seen before. Early in February, Dr. Dickler requested more imaging (CT plus &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PET&lt;/span&gt;), which showed that the cancer was spreading in Eve&amp;#8217;s bones as well as in her liver. Dr. Dickler decided to try changing Eve&amp;#8217;s chemotherapy again, this time to an older agent called Doxil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of 2008 was a difficult and painful time for Eve. Yet, despite the continued worsening of Eve&amp;#8217;s condition, as shown by the clinical measurements of her cancer, she felt somewhat better around the turn of the year. This may have been because the standard radiation to her hip had been effective, making it less painful for her to walk. We were able to make a short trip to Bethesda at the beginning of January 2009. Eve continued to teach, to see friends, to do some writing, and to make plans for more writing and travel in 2009 and beyond. We did not yet know that her doctors had, effectively, run out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part IV	Eve&amp;#8217;s final illness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have always known &lt;br /&gt;
that I would take this path,&lt;br /&gt;
but yesterday I did not know&lt;br /&gt;
that it would be today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many possible dates for the beginning of Eve&amp;#8217;s final illness.  One is Sunday, February 8, 2009. She had been walking to the bathroom and found herself walking unsteadily &amp;#8216;like a drunken sailor.&amp;#8217; After having a similar experience on Monday, she told me about these experiences.  In the weeks  prior to that she had been doing pretty well.  The autumn had been very difficult but she had gotten through that and January had not been bad.  She had felt well enough for an &amp;#8216;at home&amp;#8217; for a dozen people on New Year&amp;#8217;s Day, a trip to Bethesda, and several meals out with friends. Toward the end of January, we celebrated my birthday with lunch (lobster rolls) at the Blue Water Grill, a short walk from Eve&amp;#8217;s studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had been receiving a chemotherapy treatment (abraxane), one of whose prominent side effects was peripheral neuropathy.  Her feet were already numb from previous chemotherapy (xeloda) and I interpreted her unsteadiness as being due to increased numbness in her feet.  I got out her cane and looked up on the internet the right way to use it.  We practiced that and I encouraged her to use it to steady herself while moving around her studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 10, we went to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; for her to have hip x-rays and see Dr. Boland, a specialist in orthopedic oncology, as a follow-up  to the hairline fracture and radiation treatment she had in the autumn.  As far as I remember we had several concerns &amp;#8212; her &amp;#8216;pelvic girdle weakness,&amp;#8217; probably caused by steroids she had been given to reduce bone pain, and her concern about the possibility of femur fractures due to years of xometa &amp;#8212; but although she was using the cane I don&amp;#8217;t think we mentioned the unsteadiness (presumably because I was attributing it to the peripheral neuropathy).   Eve&amp;#8217;s primary complaint was a sharp pain that she sometimes experienced mid-spine when she straightened up.  It was a long wait to see Boland.  When we did see him, he was concerned that the pain might be a sign of instability in the spine.  We told him that Eve had recently had imaging of her spine, and he went off to study the images.  On his return he reiterated his concern and said that he would schedule Eve to be discussed by their &amp;#8216;spine board&amp;#8217; on Thursday.  He explained that the various spine specialists (himself, Lis, Bilsky, Yamada, and maybe others) spend some time together every Thursday morning going over selected cases to discuss how best to treat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, February 12, we went early to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; Breast Center (located in a building several blocks away from their main hospital) to see Eve&amp;#8217;s medical oncologist (Dr. Seidman was filling in for Dr. Dickler) and for her to have her first treatment with the new chemotherapy (doxil).  During the long morning there we got a message that Dr. Bilsky would like to see Eve at his office at the main hospital after her treatment.  We took the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; shuttle over there and got one of their wheelchairs for Eve, to make it easier (more stable and less tiring) to get around.  Bilsky told us that the spine board had examined Eve&amp;#8217;s record that morning and had concluded that there was no treatment that they could offer her now. He further explained that, although the epidural tumor in her spine was pushing on the spinal cord, he did not think it was advisable to do spinal surgery because, although he could do it, there was some chance that the bones were now too fragile for it to hold, which would make things worse than before.  He said he knew that Eve was beginning a new chemotherapy and he prayed that it would work; the implication was that it was the only treatment option available to her now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bilsky&amp;#8217;s sudden withdrawal was completely unexpected by us.  Although we certainly had been hoping to avoid spinal surgery, and had great faith in his judgment, because acting on his advice Eve had avoided surgery for almost 3 years, we had relied on surgery as an option that Eve could fall back on when it was really needed.  In the waiting room afterwards, Eve in her wheelchair was crying and I tried to comfort her, saying that although Dr. Bilsky didn&amp;#8217;t advise surgery now, if the chemotherapy worked and her situation improved, as had happened before, then surgery, if needed, might be possible sometime in the future.  Although I was trying to find a way around it, I think we both had the unspoken sense that this was a milestone in her illness, that options had been permanently foreclosed, and that the end that we had known of for so long, but had again and again managed to put off, sometimes almost with the sense that it could be put off indefinitely, was now in sight. This was 2 months before Eve&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we carried on. The next day, Friday, our friends Michael Moon and Jonathan Goldberg came into town and came to Eve&amp;#8217;s studio for drinks to be followed by dinner out, but because of Eve&amp;#8217;s increasing difficulty in getting around we ordered in. Saturday, though, we got a taxi and went to the Upper West Side apartment of Jon&amp;#8217;s cousin Sylvia and her husband Julian for dinner with them and with Mike and Jon.  Sunday, February 15, my sister Edith and her husband Cal came into town (on an Elder Hostel trip), and on Tuesday they came to Eve&amp;#8217;s for drinks and appetizers to be followed by (their anniversary) dinner at the Union Square Cafe.  Eve wasn&amp;#8217;t up to going out, however, so she stayed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, the Spring semester had started at the Graduate Center, and Eve&amp;#8217;s year-long Proust seminar had resumed.  The first meeting was Wednesday evening, January 28, from 6:30 to 8:30.  This was preceded by her office hour (from 4 to 7) on Tuesday.  (She had moved her office hour to a different day of the week because having both on the same day had become too tiring for her and she felt that it detracted from her seminar teaching.) The first few weeks no one came to her office hour, but she insisted on going anyway (I wanted her to do it only by appointment) because she wanted to be there in case someone dropped in and also, I think, because she felt that being at her office hour was part of her responsibilities to the Graduate Center, and not having many such responsibilities that required her presence there, she felt that it was important to be diligent in fulfilling this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had a comfortable armchair to sit in during her office hours, but because of the pain and tenderness in her spine, she was increasingly uncomfortable sitting in a straight-back chair. Her seminar room for the Spring semester was just down the hall from her office, so I enlisted the help of one of the other students for the first meeting and we carried her armchair to the seminar room (after that I found it was easier for me to just drag the armchair back and forth by myself).  This worked well except that it was noticeably too low for the seminar table.  Right from the beginning of the semester, then, with Eve reclined in her armchair and her head below eye level, it was apparent that something about her situation was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was different about Eve at the beginning of the Spring semester was that she was wearing a wig. In 1991, when Eve first had breast cancer, and after she had recovered from her surgery, she had six months of chemotherapy. One predictable side effect of that chemotherapy was that she lost her hair. This was deeply traumatic to her &amp;#8212; her beautiful long golden-red hair was an essential part of her image of herself. We bought a wig for her at that time, but she didn&amp;#8217;t like it and didn&amp;#8217;t wear it. Instead she acquired an amazing variety of wonderful hats and wore them whenever she was in company.  When Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer returned in 1996, it was treated for many years with hormonal therapy, which does not cause hair loss. When hormonal therapy was no longer effective, it was necessary to turn to chemotherapy, but the first chemotherapies that Eve was treated with, although they had other serious side effects, also do not cause hair loss.  Then toward the end of 2008, when it appeared that another chemotherapy was needed, the one that was selected was abraxane, which is known to cause hair loss. Eve determined to try a wig again, but to get the best one possible. We both did online research, and then we visited two places in Manhattan before selecting Joseph Paris, who makes custom wigs for women with hair loss. He carefully matched the hair colors in the wig to Eve&amp;#8217;s own and measured her hairline, which was then reproduced in the wig.  When the wig was ready, Eve&amp;#8217;s own hair was cut very short, and a stylist trimmed and styled the wig while Eve was wearing it. Then after trying it for a while she returned and had a further trim and styling. All this was expensive (about $2500) but it resulted in a wig that Eve was happy with and was confident wearing. We were both very happy with this and felt, I believe, that we had largely circumvented a recurrent trauma about hair loss. Eve did not wear the wig when she was home with only me, close friends, or the health care workers, but whenever she went out or had company, she wore it. It was ready just in time for the beginning of the Spring semester and Eve wore it to the first seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve in the past had usually taken the bus to and from the Graduate Center (or had occasionally walked) but because it was winter and because she had increasing difficulty getting on and off the bus I was reluctant for her to do it alone. So for her office hour and for her class I scheduled a car service to take her to the GC, then I came home with her, either by bus or taxi. The third week of classes, Eve went to her office hour on February 10 using a cane to stabilize her walking, but it was not very successful and seemed dangerous. She was increasingly unstable and complained of numbness in her lower legs and increasing weakness in her legs. She already owned a walker and started using that at home. On February 11 she went to her seminar, this time using the walker. I had not attached wheels to the walker, although Eve had requested them, because I was afraid that it would be unstable, but this meant that Eve had to lift the walker to move it forward on each step. It was a long slow trip to the car, to the classroom, and back, and the following day Eve had serious pains (in her shoulders as far as I remember) that were probably caused by using the walker. So I installed the wheels, which made it easier to use. I also bought a narrower walker because the standard size was too wide to get into the bathroom at her studio. And I bought some support bars to install on the toilet so that she could transfer from the walker to the support bars and sit down. But her legs continued to weaken. It was apparent that the underlying cause was most likely the tumor pressing on her spinal cord rather than numbness caused by chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Bigelows (upstairs) and bought a &amp;#8216;transport chair,&amp;#8217; a small collapsible wheelchair that would fit in the trunk of a car. We used the transport chair several times. I believe Eve skipped her office hour on February 17, but she went to her seminar on February 18 and sat in her transport chair throughout the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, February 19, I was at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SUNY&lt;/span&gt; talking to a colleague, who was about to give a noon colloquium, when my cell phone rang. It was Eve, calling from her studio; she had fallen and couldn&amp;#8217;t get up. I went there immediately. Eve had slipped out of her computer chair because her legs were too weak to support her properly; she hadn&amp;#8217;t fallen far and wasn&amp;#8217;t injured but she didn&amp;#8217;t have the strength in her legs to get up. I didn&amp;#8217;t have the strength to lift her up but between the two of we maneuvered around until we could get her up and into her chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days she fell twice more. Once she was sitting on the side of the bed and slid off; the other time I don&amp;#8217;t distinctly remember. Both times she was uninjured and together we got her back up, although with difficulty. On Monday, February 23, she had to go to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; to have a brain &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;. Dr. Seidman had ordered it because of the numbness in her feet, although he said he thought it was unlikely that was due to a brain problem (it wasn&amp;#8217;t). I took her to the car in her transport chair and then she transferred to the seat of the car, but because the car door was in the way I was unable to help her and she barely avoided falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday February 24, Eve fell twice at home. We were trying to do transfers between the bed (or one of her comfortable chairs) and I was unable to prevent her from sliding to the ground. The first time she fell we managed to maneuver her back up. The second time was late in the evening, around midnight, and we simply couldn&amp;#8217;t do it; Eve had little strength to try. I went downstairs to the front desk in her building and Sam (or Angel) came back up with me; between the two of us we were able to get her back up and into bed.  Late that night I wrote an email to Michelle, Dr. Dickler&amp;#8217;s oncology nurse at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, explaining the situation and asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Monday, February 23, I decided that doing transfers from the transport chair to the car was too risky and that we needed a vehicle that would allow her to stay in her chair throughout the trip. This was not easy to find. I called a few ambulette services and found out that even a round trip to the GC, less than a mile away, would cost over $500. Then I found online that there were some wheelchair accessible taxis and that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; had recently started a dispatch service for them. This sounded like a perfect solution so I scheduled one to take Eve to her office hour and back the following day. On Tuesday I took her downstairs in her transport chair at the scheduled time but there was no taxi. I called repeatedly but after an hour there was still no taxi nor any promise of one, so I took Eve back upstairs and we cancelled her office hour. After further phone calls it became apparent to me that this taxi dispatch service was largely ineffectual.  There were only a few wheelchair-accessible taxis in the city and none in central Manhattan. Whether they answered a call or not was voluntary, and it wasn&amp;#8217;t worth their time to drive into Manhattan and transport someone for an ordinary taxi fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 25, we still had no solution to the transportation problem so Eve stayed home and I went to the seminar by myself. We also cancelled going to see the &amp;#8216;Dollhouse&amp;#8217; with our friends Wayne and Steve on that Friday because we had no secure way of getting to Brooklyn and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory is patchier now than when I wrote the previous section.  I don&amp;#8217;t quite recall how we got through the remainder of that week.  Eve didn&amp;#8217;t go out.  At some point I went to Bigelows and bought a portable toilet for her.  That way she could transfer directly from bed or from her transport chair to the toilet.  I remember that Michelle responded to my email by connecting me with the Visiting Nurses (VN).  An appointment was scheduled with a nurse, to do an assessment, and with a physical therapist to help with the transfers. The physical therapist came and tried to show me how to hold Eve to support her during the transfers (such as from her bed to the transport chair). As I remember, this involved some fashion of reaching around under her armpits to hold her. I think this was on Friday February 28. That evening Eve had very bad pain in her shoulders. They had already been stressed by her efforts to haul herself out of her chair and were, it seems, further traumatized by the way the physical therapist was lifting her. I gave Eve her regular pain medication but also a dose of her medication for breakthrough pain as was prescribed for such situations. I don&amp;#8217;t remember the night well, but think we both slept until early in the morning when I woke up. Then I found that Eve was sleeping very heavily and I couldn&amp;#8217;t rouse her (I don&amp;#8217;t remember how hard I tried). I think I remember being concerned but hoping that she would sleep it off. I had been concerned about the difficulty of helping her get up to pee and so, as I remember, I slipped out early to go to Bigelow&amp;#8217;s to get a plastic jug designed for women to pee into.  When I returned, I tried to wake Eve again, but was unsuccessful. She would rouse a little but made only incoherent sounds and then went back to sleep. I became seriously alarmed (it reminded me of the earlier episode when she had become mentally incoherent and had spent several days in St. Vincent&amp;#8217;s hospital).  As far as I remember I called Urgent Care at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; and they sent an ambulance for her. This was Saturday, February 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve spent 10 days in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; hospital. She was transferred to a room late on the night of the 28th. I had inquired about staying with her and was told that the only way I could do this was to pay $500 per night for a private room, so I made those arrangements while she was still in urgent care. I stayed with her the entire time, only leaving twice, as far as I recall, to make brief trips home. I don&amp;#8217;t remember Eve&amp;#8217;s time at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; in detail now (although I may have notes somewhere). Here are a few things I remember. Eve&amp;#8217;s mental coherence fluctuated. After a few days in the hospital she returned pretty much to normal but a few days later she regressed a bit and then recovered again before we went home. They did numerous tests but couldn&amp;#8217;t find anything distinctly the matter that would account for her condition. I came to think it likely that her mental condition was linked to dehydration. She recovered when she was on hydration therapy, deteriorated when taken off of it, and recovered again when it was restored. Also, she had a catheter in place so that I could see the color of her urine in the bag and could judge how well hydrated she was from that. [Eve had always consumed large quantities of iced tea or ice water all during the day but I observed &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t remember when I first noticed this &amp;#8212; that although she always had a large mug by her side she was actually drinking much less. After she returned from the hospital I encouraged her to drink more but with little success.] I was unhappy about aspects of her treatment at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;. Her own oncologist, Maura Dickler did not see her; instead she was seen by the oncologist who was on rotation at the hospital that week, a woman whom I came to like not at all. At the hospital the leading idea was that Eve had overdosed on her pain medicine, and their response was to take her off of pain medication entirely. This left her in some pain continuously and made it very painful when the nurses&amp;#8217; aides tried to roll her over so that they could change the linens and clean her. The hospital system was unresponsive; the attending doctor came through on rounds briefly in the morning, and it was very difficult to get anything done for the rest of the day. I did finally get some degree of pain medication restored and Eve was more comfortable after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she was in the hospital, she was seen regularly by physical therapists who taught her some exercises to strengthen her legs and who helped her out of bed and into a wheelchair so that she could sit up for a while.  We wheeled around the halls on her floor and went up to the recreation floor once or twice. The length of her stay was in part caused by the weekend that came at the end of it, and was in part caused by the recognized need to set up some system for her care when she went home. Her legs had weakened to the point that I was not competent to make transfers with her although the physical therapist could. The physical therapists had the idea, as I remember, that Eve should not go straight home from the hospital but instead should go into an institutional setting where she could have professional physical therapy. As I learned more about it (I had gotten my laptop computer from home), it became apparent that Eve could not go into a full-strength rehabilitation center because the demands of therapy in such centers are more than she could handle. Instead she would need to go into what&amp;#8217;s called a sub-acute facility which has, as I recall, one hour a day of physical therapy (5 days a week) and perhaps an hour a day of occupational therapy. Eve was initially positive about doing this. She was willing to devote the time to trying to build up enough strength to regain her independence of movement. As I looked into it more, however, there were considerable drawbacks. The available facilities seemed to be in what were basically nursing homes, where Eve would have to be in residence 24 hours a day in order to receive her 2 hours of therapy; although I could visit her during the day, it appeared that I would not be allowed to stay with her during the night; and it seemed that the typical stays in such places were measured in months rather than being a few weeks as Eve and I had initially imagined. Also, it seemed that we could approach the same level of therapy at home through the Visiting Nurses. Finally, although I&amp;#8217;m not sure I said this to Eve, I was concerned that if her condition continued to worsen due to increased tumor pressure on her spinal cord, no amount of effort put into physical therapy for her legs would be helpful.  After we discussed what I had learned, Eve decided not to pursue the acute-care option, but to go straight home instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required that a support system be in place as soon as she went home because I could no longer manage without it. In particular we needed a hospital bed for her, a real wheelchair, and a mechanical lift that could be used to get her out of bed and into her wheelchair or onto the toilet. And I needed some advance training in using the lift. These lifts are sometimes called Hauer lifts, although not all of them are made by Hauer. They had one at the hospital, and the two physical therapists demonstrated its use to me several times. Eve had to roll over in bed so that a fabric sling could be placed under her. This was fastened by chains to an overhead arm of the lift that could then be elevated by a manually operated hydraulic pump, lifting Eve out of bed and suspending her in the air. The lift was on wheels so that she could then be positioned over the wheelchair and lowered into it. The lift obviously had to be used with great care so as to avoid any possibility of dropping her, but apart from that was not difficult to use. The therapists were insistent that two people were needed to operate it, but I found a home video on YouTube in which a man demonstrated how either he or a helper could use the lift by him- or herself. Subsequently, I used the lift at home by myself without much difficulty. I was the only person who used it at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of Eve&amp;#8217;s stay at the hospital we had two visits from Nessa Coyle, a nurse practioner and PhD who, I later learned, has been a pioneer in palliative care, going back to 1969.  She seemed like a wonderful person. The first time she came into the room Eve was sleeping so she stayed for quite a while talking to me about hospice and palliative care. Then she came back the next day when Eve was awake and talked with both of us. She was very kind and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t remember Eve having any visitors while she was in the hospital, although she may have had some. But on Tuesday, March 10, which was the day that she was discharged, Michael was in town and came to visit. This was very helpful because that morning was also the beginning of my teaching obligations that Spring. Michael sat with Eve while I went to give my lectures. Then in the afternoon I returned to the hospital and Eve and I were taken to her studio in an ambulance. I had already had the equipment delivered so it was there when we arrived. Eve was then home for just a month. It was to be Friday, April 10, when she was taken to the hospice at Beth Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a difficult month.  Eve was approved for four hours a day, five days a week of home care from a home health aide, but this proved to be of limited usefulness. The first day the aide didn&amp;#8217;t show up. I then learned that, although in principle I could vary the hours on a day-to-day basis, the only way to get the same person for an extended period was to have them come for the same hours, either the morning or the evening, every day. This was because they were also scheduling other appointments for the other part of the day. The second aide seemed competent but intent on doing no more than she was asked; then she left after a few days to return to a previous patient who had been in the hospital but was now home again. The third aide seemed willing but was very limited in her competence so that there was little for her to do. None of the aides wanted to have anything to do with the Hauer lift and I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have felt that it was safe for them to use it even if they had been willing.  None of them could do any kind of medical care, such as wound care, and the third aide, who was with us the longest, was reluctant even to help with washing Eve or moving her in bed and wasn&amp;#8217;t very competent even in changing the sheets and making the bed. I learned only at the very end of the month that the aides were paid so very little (maybe $7 per hour) that it was unrealistic to expect more from them and that I should instead have used private hires, for which I received a number of recommended names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting Nurses assigned the same physical therapist that Eve had seen before going into the hospital, but he had hurt her so badly then that she, very reasonably, refused to see him again. She did see an occupational therapist, however, who came a number of times, helped her with exercises, and taught her exercises to do on her own. This was of limited use because Eve&amp;#8217;s legs continued to weaken. Although initially she could lift her legs and move them while she was in bed (although they were not nearly strong enough to bear her weight if she had tried to stand up), she could do less and less over time and after several weeks could do not even move her toes. At this point the therapist said that he really could not justify further visits to the insurance company and so he stopped coming. A social worker paid one visit. I remember that she gave me some useful information but I don&amp;#8217;t remember now what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this care was managed by the visiting nurse, who came several times a week for what was often a quite brief visit.  Initially she seemed to spend most of her time filling out paperwork to justify further visits.  Later she seemed more attentive to Eve herself, but it seemed to me that some problems that developed could have been prevented or at least lessened if she had been paying closer attention initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these last two months of Eve&amp;#8217;s life, her bowel functions were a persistent problem and became a preoccupying one for Eve. There were two reasons for this. First, her pain medications tended to make her constipated, and second, as her mobility lessened, it became harder for her to get to the toilet. It was frustrating. Because such functions are not entirely voluntary she would want to have a bowel movement and sometimes feel that she could, only to find, after we had gotten her to the toilet with considerable difficulty, that she could not. She was already constipated when she went to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; hospital and became even more so while there.  Finally, sometime in the middle of her stay, she had a more effectual nurse, who gave her what was needed to induce a bowel movement while she was in bed and literally helped to scoop out the blockage. By the time Eve left the hospital though she was becoming constipated again. The Hauer lift provided by the insurance company came with two slings, one of which had a hole in it to allow it to be used on the toilet. The problem, however, which only became apparent over time, was that the edges of the hole were abrasive so that the pressure on Eve&amp;#8217;s bottom, when she was suspended in the lift began to create wounds along the line of the hole. The visiting nurse finally noticed these and became quite worried about them, because of the fear of infection, but treating them was difficult because Eve was lying in bed much of the time. The problem of constipation was now aggravated because I was afraid of using the toilet sling for fear of further injuring Eve&amp;#8217;s legs. I ordered another sling that seemed as though it might be better, but when it arrived it was skimpier than advertised and I was afraid to use it for fear that Eve might slip out of it. Dr. Bilsky had visited Eve in the hospital and had confirmed that Eve&amp;#8217;s gradual loss of leg function was due to the tumor pressing on her spinal cord. When I asked him about the course of this, he had said that Eve would eventually lose all use of her legs and eventually also lose control of her bowels but that this would be the last to go. This did happen, sometime around her last week at home, and after that constipation was no longer a problem. Her bowels moved on their own, while she was in bed, and then the aide or I cleaned her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had requested and received a good wheelchair from the insurance company.  It had a reclinable back, a good headrest, and good leg supports, which could be elevated.  It also seemed that Eve could maneuver it herself.  Our intention was that Eve could sit for extended periods during the day and could sit at her computer in her wheelchair and do her work, email, and so forth.  Also, she could sit in her wheelchair to receive company.  During the week that Eve was in the hospital, she had to cancel her office hour and to miss her seminar (which went on without her, guided by two of the students, who served as facilitators).  It had already occurred to us, however, that after Eve returned home it would be easier for her to meet her students at her studio than to go to the Graduate Center. Her students were willing to do this. So for three weeks, on Wednesday evenings, March 11, 18, and 25, Eve held her Proust seminar at home. This worked reasonably well. Before the seminar I would hoist Eve out of bed and into her wheelchair, help her get somewhat dressed (in a nice top with a lap robe over her bed gown and catheter bag), and help her put on her wig. Then I would wheel her into the living room and shut the door to the other room which had the hospital bed and equipment in it. As Eve had already arranged, each class had two students facilitating and she could add her comments whenever she wished.  I bought beer and soda and ordered in pizzas from Patsy&amp;#8217;s, so the gatherings were congenial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty of this period was that I was teaching two courses at my college, which was making a transition from the quarter system to the semester system that required me to be teaching my visual perception courses under both systems concurrently, requiring lectures on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sometimes the home health aide was there during the time I had to be away, but sometimes not. At first I thought I could set Eve up in her wheelchair and then leave for a few hours to lecture (I don&amp;#8217;t remember now how often this happened) but I eventually came to think that this was not safe even though Eve and I both had cell phones. Then I had to arrange for someone to be with Eve while I was away. Eve students and friends Claudia and T were both very helpful in volunteering to do this. Her brother David also came to visit for several days shortly after Eve got out of the hospital and was very helpful in this and other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus during the first part of this period, and Eve&amp;#8217;s too I think, was on learning to live with the lift and the wheelchair. Eve ordered several books about people with disabilities and did some online research about electrically-powered wheelchairs. She didn&amp;#8217;t go out very much, but I did take her out a few times (I don&amp;#8217;t remember how many) just to wheel around the neighborhood. On March 17 we wheeled down to Dr. Goldstein&amp;#8217;s office on 5th Avenue at 14th Street for Eve to have a checkup with him following her stay in the hospital. This was quite convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; was much more of a problem. I had discussed this with the social worker while Eve was in the hospital. It seemed that there were only two options. The first option was the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; Access-a-Ride program. This program would send a wheelchair accessible van for the cost of a bus token. The problem was that the program required going for an interview and there was an almost two-month wait for the interview. We (David, I think) did schedule such an interview, but Eve died before her appointment. The other option was an ambulance service, whose name the social worker gave me, that was willing to make round trips to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt;, as non-emergency transportation, for &amp;#8216;only&amp;#8217; $200 round trip (which was not covered by insurance). On Monday March 23 we used the ambulance to go to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; for an appointment with their pain management specialist, Dr. Tickoo. Although this seemed like a worthwhile contact to have made, the transportation was expensive and cumbersome. On Friday, March 27th, our friend Adam Frank came to visit. I got Eve dressed up and into her wheelchair and we all wheeled down into the West Village where Adam treated us to falafel. It was pleasant weather and we had our food out on the sidewalk because the little shop wouldn&amp;#8217;t comfortably accommodate Eve&amp;#8217;s wheelchair.  This was a very pleasant excursion. It also marked the end, although we didn&amp;#8217;t know it yet, of our attempt to construct a version of a normal life out of Eve&amp;#8217;s situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time after Eve came home from the hospital, she had little appetite for food or beverages. I was concerned, as mentioned above, about her becoming dehydrated and did what I could to encourage her to drink more, but to little effect. Whether because of dehydration, or for other reasons, or both, beginning on Saturday, March 28th, Eve had a significant loss in her ability to express herself verbally. The symptoms were frustrating, both to her and others.  Her voice sounded normal and expressive and she appeared to be alert and cognitively clear but she couldn&amp;#8217;t find the words she wanted and often substituted unclear non-words in their place.  Many rote or spontaneous expressions were perfectly fine but it seemed that just when she came to the crux of what she wanted to say, she couldn&amp;#8217;t. I can&amp;#8217;t remember clearly enough to do justice to the complexity of her condition. Sometimes I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how clear she was cognitively. Adam came to visit for a while on that Saturday and sat with Eve for some time. He later described her as seeming absorbed in an elaborate fantasy about having a bowel movement. This aphasic condition, if that&amp;#8217;s the correct term, fluctuated somewhat in intensity over the following days, and sometimes for short periods Eve&amp;#8217;s ability to converse seemed almost normal, or at least enough so to have a conversation, but mostly it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were heart-breaking moments. T tried producing a vocabulary of pictures (food, beverage, etc.) that Eve could point at to convey her meaning, but this didn&amp;#8217;t help. Then T gave Eve a pencil and paper and Eve tried to write but produced only a scribble. Eve&amp;#8217;s mother Rita came from Bethesda to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;, staying with her sister Elaine in Queens, and they both came to visit Eve. On April 5th, I think, with all of us sitting by her bed Eve launched into an animated story about Claudia (I think it may have been about her being a rock star) that went on for some time but was an incomprehensible mix of words and non-words. When she finished she looked at us and it was clear that we hadn&amp;#8217;t understood. Then she expressed her frustration, exclaiming plaintively and perfectly clearly &amp;#8220;I tried so hard.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve had had her second chemotherapy treatment with doxil while she was in the hospital. She had had an appointment for it at the breast center, but I contacted Dr. Dickler&amp;#8217;s office and then spoke to Dr. Dickler on the phone to arrange for the treatment to be given at the hospital.  At that time Dr. Dickler shocked me by saying something, I forget her words, that suggested a doubt as to whether it was worth continuing with the treatment.  She said something about Eve not being able to walk, which I then took as implying that if you can&amp;#8217;t walk then life is no longer worth living; I don&amp;#8217;t remember just what I said in reply but I rejected that implication. I replied that Eve had just started the new treatment so that it was too early to know if it would be effective. Dr. Dickler then gave her consent for the chemotherapy in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday March 30, Eve had an appointment at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; breast center to see Dr. Dickler and to have her third doxil treatment. Again I hired an ambulance to take us there.  It was a long day and I&amp;#8217;m not sure now that I remember the sequence of things, but this is how I recall it. Eve had her blood drawn and then we waited to see Dr. Dickler, but there was a long delay. Eve also had an appointment to see Dr. Massie, the psychiatrist. She had been feeling some time before that she wanted to boost up her antidepressants and so had scheduled that appointment, which was in a different &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; building, with a wheelchair accessible shuttle that ran between them.  Eve was scheduled to see Dr. Massie after Dr. Dickler, but because Dr. Dickler was delayed, we went to see Dr. Massie first, going to the other building by shuttle. Dr. Massie came out to the waiting room to greet us. I asked whether I should come in too, and she said she would prefer that I stayed in the waiting room, which I did. Presumably she found that she couldn&amp;#8217;t communicate well with Eve, so she came back out and asked me to join them, which I did. I don&amp;#8217;t remember now what was she said although I remember her being sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then took the shuttle back to the breast center and, after a long wait, saw Dr. Dickler. She said that Eve&amp;#8217;s blood counts were too low for her to have chemotherapy that day. She went on to say that she didn&amp;#8217;t think further treatments would be helpful to Eve. She said that she thought the blood counts were low because the cancer was destroying the bone marrow and so limiting Eve&amp;#8217;s body&amp;#8217;s ability to regenerate the blood. She said that, although she didn&amp;#8217;t think it would help, she could, if we wanted, try a gentler chemotherapy, but Eve would still have to wait a while (a couple of weeks perhaps &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t exactly remember) to see if her blood counts recovered enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was clearly the definitive moment of being told that Eve was dying: the moment when the doctor says or clearly implies that it&amp;#8217;s time to switch from treatment to hospice.  We had known that this moment would come eventually. I had thought, I guess, that it might come if the current chemotherapy, after several more treatments, proved to be ineffectual. But it came sooner than expected and took me by surprise like a physical blow. I had difficulty speaking but asked, without quite saying what I meant, if Dr. Dickler had an estimate of how long. She clearly knew what I meant and replied &amp;#8220;a few weeks, maybe a few months.&amp;#8221; She was right; Eve had less than two weeks to live. As far as I remember, I believed at the time that  Eve understood the meaning of what Dr. Dickler was saying. I can&amp;#8217;t remember if Eve said anything then or what I said to her.  It was a hard moment.  The ambulance took us home.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home I thought about who else to consult.  I thought of Dr. Chang but had found in the past that he was unwilling to be consulted without an actual appointment and visit which would have been difficult, requiring an ambulance again to get there and back. I thought of Eric Winer, but he was not closely acquainted with Eve&amp;#8217;s current situation and so couldn&amp;#8217;t be expected to offer an opinion without seeing her in Boston, which wouldn&amp;#8217;t be possible. And I thought of Dr. Goldstein, whom I called. I left a message and he called back in the evening (it might have been Tuesday or even Wednesday). He too took me by surprise, saying that when he had seen Eve after she got out of the hospital he had thought then that she was dying and probably had only a few weeks to live; but he hadn&amp;#8217;t said anything then, preferring to wait until we saw Dr. Dickler. This independently-reached agreement between Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Dickler convinced me, and I didn&amp;#8217;t seek any additional consultation. It seemed to me later, when I thought about it, that physicians experienced with dying patients may have learned to perceive signs of death&amp;#8217;s approach that are not evident on tests, and perhaps are not even articulable to themselves, but which, nevertheless, are clearly evident to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening, after my conversation with Goldstein, I spent several hours searching the web for information that might help me understand Eve&amp;#8217;s prognosis. I learned that medicine is divided (at least by some researchers) into three branches &amp;#8212; diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis &amp;#8212; and that prognosis is considered to be the least developed of these branches. There is a great deal of statistical information about disease progression in populations, which allowed Eve&amp;#8217;s doctors to tell her, when her breast cancer metastasized, that the average life span in that situation was two to three years, but much less information that allows confident prognosis to be made on an individual basis. Some doctors, perhaps the better ones, will venture an intuitive prediction (Eric Winer, at that time, said something like &amp;#8220;I have a feeling you&amp;#8217;re going to be around for a long time&amp;#8221;); others will not. Doctors may be more willing to share an intuition if it&amp;#8217;s positive than if it&amp;#8217;s negative. Dr. Goldstein, as he said, had an intuition about Eve&amp;#8217;s approaching death but refrained from mentioning it until the specialist had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned, that evening, that those few researchers working on prognosis had found different typical patterns with different mortal diseases.  Some diseases (I think heart disease is an example) follow a pattern with abrupt changes &amp;#8212; a person may go from apparent good health to death in minutes or may be almost dead and yet recover good health.  Metastatic cancer was described as a disease with a more gradual pattern &amp;#8212; patients may stay for some time (years in Eve&amp;#8217;s case) on an uneven plateau, having ups and downs but still able to maintain some approximation to a normal life, but then they begin an irreversible slide downhill and reach the end within a few weeks or months.  It is this pattern, which I had not previously read or been told about, that Eve seemed to be following. Drs. Dickler and Goldstein, with their experience, were presumably able to discern that downhill slide, while I was unable to distinguish it from a depression in the plateau that Eve had occupied for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had gotten some advice about hospice programs from both Dr. Dickler and Dr. Goldstein and set out to learn more about them and to decide which of the available ones would be best for Eve. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a sense of great urgency because it seemed that what the hospice programs offered at home was not much different from what the Visiting Nurses offered. It seemed to me that what was most important was what facilities the hospice had for in-patient care if that was needed. The Visiting Nurses had a hospice program but their in-patient care was provided on contract to various hospitals and that didn&amp;#8217;t sound good to me so I set them aside. The leading candidate was the Cabrini hospice program at Cabrini Medical Center on East 19th Street. It was one of the oldest programs in the country and had a very good reputation. I set out to make an appointment but there was some confusion about some paperwork that they wanted from Dr. Goldstein so that it took several days before their intake nurse came to see me and Eve. Meanwhile I learned that the Cabrini Medical Center had been closed for about a year but the hospice program had continued. When the nurse came to visit I had a number of questions that she was unable to answer. She said she would find out and call me back; but she never did. I then visited the hospice itself, which appeared to be the only occupied floor of an otherwise unoccupied hospital building. This in itself was somewhat creepy and raised questions in my mind about how good their support might be. I also worried that many hospice staff had left when the hospital closed and that they might be understaffed, making their care questionable. It&amp;#8217;s possible that their program was fine, but I didn&amp;#8217;t find out. Instead I decided to look into the other leading candidate, which was the Jacob Perlow hospice at Beth Israel Medical Center on 1st Avenue and 16th Street.  I visited their hospice unit (on Sunday, April 5, as far as I can recall), which did not have a floor to itself but was closed off from the rest of the hospital. And I made an appointment for their in-take nurse to visit Eve and me. By the time of this visit it was Thursday, April 9.  The intake nurse was Philomena Mahon; she was accompanied by Susan Stowens, a hospice social worker who was a Buddhist connected to Shambala and who was connected to Eve through a mutual friend, but I can&amp;#8217;t remember who that was. Again, I had a number of questions that they needed to check on and that I wanted answered before I signed Eve up with them. They suggested, however, that I fill out the paperwork and that they then hold it until I gave them the OK. That way another visit wouldn&amp;#8217;t be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of my hypothesis that Eve&amp;#8217;s cognitive condition was linked to hydration, I did what I could, after we returned from the hospital, to encourage her to drink fluids. Eve expressed herself as being willing to do so but somehow she couldn&amp;#8217;t take much. Initially her catheter was removed when she left the hospital, but because of the difficulty in helping her transfer from the bed to the portable toilet when she needed to pee, we decided it would be better to have a catheter in place, and at our request the visiting nurse put one in within a few days after Eve came home. Thus I was again able to see her urine in the catheter bag and judge from that how dehydrated she was. When we had our last visit with Dr. Dickler, on March 30, I discussed Eve&amp;#8217;s hydration with her and she agreed to prescribe one liter of fluid several times a week (three I think) to be administered at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On  Tuesday March 31 the necessary equipment was delivered to Eve&amp;#8217;s studio and the following day Diana, a nurse from Trinity Home Care came to set things up and to give me detailed training in how to do the hydration for Eve. For this purpose, Eve had to have an IV line. As far as I can remember now, the IV that Eve had at the hospital had been taken out before she left, and the hydration nurse installed a new one, but it&amp;#8217;s possible that Eve came home from the hospital with her IV line still in place. In any case, with the IV in place it was a straightforward procedure to access it, do the hydration over the course of an hour or so, and then de-access and flush the IV. So after Diana showed me how to do it, I was able to do it in the future without a problem. After several days it occurred to me, however, that Dickler&amp;#8217;s prescription was probably based on the protocol used with ambulatory patients who came to the cancer center to have their hydration rather than having it at home. It differed considerably from the hospital, where 2 liters a day were administered and it was done much more slowly, continuously over the 24 hour period as far as I remember. These thoughts were occasioned in part by failing to see much positive effect from the home hydration. Eve&amp;#8217;s aphasia did not improve reliably and her urine still looked too concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, on Wednesday April 8, Dr. Goldstein paid Eve a house call. I hadn&amp;#8217;t suggested it, but his office called to ask if he could come by to see Eve. Of course I said yes. I remember that when he came in and started to talk to Eve, she was sitting up in bed and her aphasia was not immediately apparent.  He said something like &amp;#8220;how are you feeling?&amp;#8221; and she responded conventionally with something like &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m feeling fine, thanks.&amp;#8221;  It was only when he asked a question that required a less conventional response that Eve&amp;#8217;s answer became hesitant and it became apparent that she couldn&amp;#8217;t find the words she wanted and so wasn&amp;#8217;t able to express herself. Nevertheless, I spoke to him after he was done with his exam and he said that Eve was doing better than he had expected.  I asked him if we could try doing 1 liter per day of hydration and doing it more slowly; I explained that I hoped it would help with Eve&amp;#8217;s aphasia.  Dr. Goldstein said that he doubted if it would help but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t hurt to try, so he gave a prescription for this revised dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember telling him that I was concerned that I hadn&amp;#8217;t been getting Eve out of bed to sit in her wheelchair for several days (I don&amp;#8217;t clearly remember why but probably because of the other needs that had to be attended to; also I may have been concerned about her ability to maintain herself in the chair and not slide down in it), and Dr. Goldstein replied that at this time there was no point in bothering Eve with getting her into her wheelchair. My concern about the wheelchair helps me now to remember that at that point, although I accepted that Eve was dying, I did not think of her death as imminent (nor, it seemed, did Dr. Goldstein).&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, I don&amp;#8217;t remember how long, Eve&amp;#8217;s appetite for food had been diminished, as was her appetite for fluids. In the hospital, because the food was unappealing, and because of her other problems there, she didn&amp;#8217;t eat much.  After we came home, her appetite was very small. It was a challenge to find anything that she cared to eat and even then she didn&amp;#8217;t eat much. She was clearly losing weight but because she had a surplus she was not,and did not, become alarmingly thin. At some point, I forget when exactly, I became concerned about all the pills she had to take. For years she had been taking many pills, perhaps fifty or so, each day, which I arranged in daily pill boxes in bins for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime. She had never had a problem with this, swallowing many pills at a gulp without difficulty. But now it had become a problem. During the last couple of weeks it was increasingly difficult to persuade her to take all her pills. I reduced the number of pills by first cutting out the supplements and then, after consulting with someone (Dr. Goldstein, I think), by opening some pills that were in capsule form and mixing them with applesauce, but this could not be done with the pain pills and besides even the applesauce became increasingly difficult for Eve to eat. I was most concerned about her pain pills and her antidepressant. I consulted by phone with an associate of Dr. Tickoo, the pain specialist, and he ordered a morphine drip to replace the pain pills. This turned out to be relatively straightforward to implement because Eve already had an IV, and Trinity Home Care, the service responsible for Eve&amp;#8217;s hydration, could also do the morphine. On Tuesday, April 7, Diana came and set it up. The morphine was administered continuously by a pump, and the amount was controlled and locked by the nurse, so I didn&amp;#8217;t need to deal with it. There was a &amp;#8220;Y&amp;#8221; junction in the IV so that both the morphine and the hydration could be administered through the same IV.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Sunday after Eve came home from the hospital, I believe it was March 22, Josh Wilner came over for a visit. Eve and I were still thinking ahead, about how we would deal with Eve being in a wheelchair. We were also thinking about Eve&amp;#8217;s position at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; and whether she would be able to keep teaching. We discussed all this with Josh and he very generously proposed that he and Eve plan to teach a seminar together in fall of 2009. I forget now what the topic was, but it made good sense as something they could do together. The idea was that if all went well they would team-teach the seminar, as they did with the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ZICS&lt;/span&gt; (zero, infinity, chaos, sublimity) seminar a few years before. And if Eve because of her health was occasionally not able to make it to seminar, then Josh would teach it by himself. This flexible arrangement made it possible for Eve in good conscience to plan to continue with her &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; position rather than moving toward a disability retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday March 24 Eve held her office hours at her studio in the evening.  At least a couple of people came. I opened the door when someone came, then withdrew into the other room. I really don&amp;#8217;t remember this well but I think there was a brief visit or two and the last visitor was her student Zach. Some time past and I looked into the room to find Eve asleep in her wheelchair and Zach gone.  I&amp;#8217;ve never asked him about what his visit, but this reminds me that already I was concerned about Eve&amp;#8217;s cognitive condition &amp;#8211; I probably had been, off and on, ever since the stay in the hospital. It&amp;#8217;s very difficult for me to remember in any detail and describe now, but I think I wasn&amp;#8217;t confident of Eve&amp;#8217;s always being able to stay focused on the conversation, to follow it fully, to be sharp in her contribution to it. I had something of the same concern during her seminar the following evening. Eve didn&amp;#8217;t say much, and I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how closely she was following. The two student facilitators carried the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on Saturday March 28, Eve developed the aphasia I&amp;#8217;ve already described.  I was hoping over the weekend that it would lift. That the hydration would help.  But it didn&amp;#8217;t seem to. It was a characteristic of Eve&amp;#8217;s condition that although sometimes she struggled to find words, sometimes her speech was fluent but the words were not recognizable. It was as though she knew what the words were and they were clear to her but were garbled in the production. And she seemed not to realize it until she saw that she wasn&amp;#8217;t understood. So I don&amp;#8217;t think she initially understood the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, March 30, before the appointment with Dr. Dickler, perhaps during one of the intervals when Eve&amp;#8217;s aphasia was less, I said to Eve that I didn&amp;#8217;t think she was up to having her office hour on Tuesday. It was clear to me that Eve was hurt by my saying this. This was very painful to me but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to expose her or the students to what I was afraid would be the very awkward and embarrassing situation of Eve&amp;#8217;s aphasia. What was so very painful to me was the sense that I had from Eve that this was something that she did not agree with, that I was imposing it on her, that I was not on her side. She said, rather coldly as I remember, &amp;#8220;If you think so.&amp;#8221; Certainly this was one of the most difficult moments of her illness for me, but it seemed inescapable and so I do not regret what I did. I wrote and sent the email under Eve&amp;#8217;s name. I left the question of the Wednesday seminar open, but then on Tuesday evening I wrote, again under her name, to say that Eve was not well enough to attend the seminar and that it should meet at the Graduate Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at Eve&amp;#8217;s email for the month of March gives an idea of the progression of her condition. She sent a number of emails between March 17th and March 23rd and so was clearly sitting in her wheelchair at her computer and attending to her correspondence. As late as Monday, March 23rd she was making promises of work she would do over the next few months. Then there is a short email to the Proust seminar, written early on the afternoon of Wednesday, March 25th, saying that the seminar would meet that evening at her studio, but I think that I wrote that email. The few emails sent under Eve&amp;#8217;s name in the following days were all written by me, but with Eve&amp;#8217;s concurrence.  So it seems that Monday March 23rd may have been the last day that she sat at her computer. If so, I&amp;#8217;m sure that at that time we didn&amp;#8217;t know that it would be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look ahead, concerning Eve&amp;#8217;s seminar, the next two weeks were spring break at the Graduate Center, so Eve&amp;#8217;s Proust seminar was not scheduled on the first two Wednesdays of April. The following Wednesday, April 22, after Eve&amp;#8217;s death was known to the graduate students, Josh very kindly took over the seminar for its final four meetings, ending May 13. So, due to Josh&amp;#8217;s unstinting helpfulness and Eve&amp;#8217;s forethought in creating several years earlier her method of having graduate student facilitators, the Proust seminar carried through, uninterrupted, to its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Eve was in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MSK&lt;/span&gt; hospital, we talked about how to let her friends know what was going on without having to write to or call each of them individually.  We started to make a list of close friends, with the idea of making a mailing list that email bulletins could be sent to about Eve&amp;#8217;s condition. After Eve got out of the hospital, David came to stay with us and help out for several days, as I have mentioned. One of the very helpful things that he did was to take that list of names and, with Eve&amp;#8217;s help, expand it and find email addresses for it. Then he and Eve together composed an email about her condition and sent it to the list (perplexingly, I can&amp;#8217;t find that email in either Eve&amp;#8217;s or my gmail). After David went home, Claudia took over the mailing list and the role of communicating with Eve&amp;#8217;s friends. This was an immense help to me because I was very much occupied, and considerably stressed, by the dual responsibilities of managing Eve&amp;#8217;s care and keeping up with my teaching and other responsibilities at my college. Claudia came to function as a kind of gatekeeper, deflecting well-wishing friends by letting them know that neither Eve nor I was able to be very communicative. (For almost a year after Eve died, Claudia continued in this very helpful function for me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people sent cards and little gifts, which I have still have not found myself able to respond to as I would wish.  And some people, especially from out of town, came to see Eve.  Here is a no-doubt partial list, from my calendar:  Adam Frank, as I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned, came for several days at the end of March; Eve&amp;#8217;s nephew Adam and his wife Betsy accompanied her mother Rita up from Bethesda on the bus, visited with us in the afternoon and evening of April 4th, and then returned to the Bethesda the following day; Rita stayed with her sister Elaine, coming in from Queens several times to see Eve, and not going home until after she died; Eve&amp;#8217;s student and friend Greg came to see her on April 5th;   her friend and teacher Neil came on the afternoon of April 7th; Josh came at noon on April 8th. Mike and Jon came to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; for several days, arriving at Eve&amp;#8217;s studio late in the morning on April 10th; they arrived just as Eve, after an unexpected downturn in her condition, was about to be taken to the Beth Israel hospice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, April 8, I gave Eve the usual hydration that she had been receiving.  Then on Thursday, with the new prescription from Dr. Goldstein, I started her on the daily hydration: the same 1 liter amount but delivered much more slowly.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember much about that Thursday. My calendar shows that Rita and Elaine came to visit again in the afternoon. It was Passover, so I had no classes to teach and was with Eve. This was also the day on which I had the visit from the Beth Israel hospice. As far as I remember Eve slept most of the day but was awake for some of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime Thursday night, possibly toward morning as far as I remember, I became aware that Eve&amp;#8217;s breathing had changed. It sounded as though there was liquid in her throat or windpipe and as though she might be in danger of not getting enough air. The sound was very disturbing to me. This condition persisted into the morning. Now, after having put off signing Eve up for the hospice on Thursday because of questions I wanted answered, I began to wish she were already in the hospice program so that she could have access to their in-patient care at Beth Israel. This was Good Friday, with the Easter weekend approaching, and I worried that it might be Monday before she could be enrolled.  Mid-morning the visiting nurse came and examined Eve. She confirmed my belief that Eve should be receiving in-patient care. I called Susan Stowens, told her about Eve&amp;#8217;s changed condition, and said that I urgently wanted to complete her enrollment immediately so that she could be admitted to the hospice in-patient unit. Susan then called Philomena, the nurse who had visited with her, and who was at home because it was Good Friday, and also called Donna Pierre Pierre, one of the hospice administrators; among the three of them they very kindly did was what needed to get Eve enrolled. I wanted Eve to go to the hospice immediately, so that she could get help with her breathing, but now it appeared that there were no vacant beds. Then somehow they managed to make a bed available, and an ambulance was sent to take Eve there. It was about 1 pm on Friday, April 10. Eve had not woken up that day, nor did she wake up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a difficult morning. In addition to my anxiety about getting Eve enrolled in and admitted to the hospice, there was a phone message (I don&amp;#8217;t remember why the phone wasn&amp;#8217;t answered) from her close friend Cynthia Chase, who sounded distraught, saying that she had decided that she had to see Eve and so was taking the bus from Ithaca and would stay with their friend Andy. I called Andy to tell him what was happening and ask him if he would please intercept Cynthia or get a message to her because there would be no one at Eve&amp;#8217;s studio when she arrived. (Andy said he would do this but somehow he failed to connect; I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happened, but Cynthia apparently never got the message, and went back to Ithaca.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about noon, just as I was arranging for Eve to go to the hospice, Mike and Jon, who had come from Atlanta to see Eve, arrived. Eve&amp;#8217;s condition, which they had no reason to have expected, was of course very upsetting to them. They left about the time that the ambulance crew arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made another appointment for that afternoon.  Susan Stowens had given me a few names of private-hire home health aides, and I had called one the day before and made an appointment for her to visit us and talk about caring for Eve.  Now I had to call and leave her a message saying that Eve was going to the hospice and we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be needing her help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ambulance people arrived at the studio and bundled Eve onto a stretcher.  As we were coming out of the elevator we met the home health aide who had been caring for Eve, rather ineffectually, arriving for her afternoon shift.  I told her too that we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be needing her help anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambulance ride was disturbing. One of the attendants was an officious women who seemed hostile to the whole concept of the hospice, where she knew we were going, and determined to administer every test and procedure possible in the 5 minutes it took to drive to 1st Avenue and 16th Street. I finally told her to stop, which she reluctantly did, but she still caused me a fearful moment when we arrived at the hospice and the nurse there looked at all the apparatus that Eve had been hooked up to and said that if Eve needed all that monitoring she would have to be in the emergency room (which I desperately wanted to avoid). I protested that it was all the work of the ambulance crew; then a doctor arrived and took in the situation. She told the crew to unhook Eve, transfer her to the hospice bed and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while, maybe a few hours, for Eve to be taken care of, but she was unhooked from her portable morphine pump and connected to the hospice one, and she was washed and tended to and put into one of their gowns.  A suction tube was used to vacuum some of the fluid from her windpipe and she was given medicine (by means of a patch on her arm, if I remember correctly) to help dry out the excess fluid in her body.  She was running a low fever, possibly from an infection, and was given something like aspirin for that. (In keeping with the hospice philosophy, all of the treatment was directed towards alleviating the symptoms, not toward &amp;#8216;curing&amp;#8217; the underlying problem, so she was not given antibiotics.) By the evening the gargling drowning sound in her breathing was gone and she appeared to be sleeping comfortably.  As I&amp;#8217;ve said, she was asleep, or unconscious, through all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems probable to me now that the hydration had contributed to the fluid buildup that so disturbed Eve&amp;#8217;s breathing. I mentioned the hydration to the hospice nurse that first afternoon (perhaps I was asking if they were going to give her hydration) and she showed me that Eve&amp;#8217;s legs were swollen by fluid that was accumulating there. She explained to me that Eve&amp;#8217;s body was no longer able to process the fluid that she was given. Eve received neither food nor fluids (as far as I recall) for the two days she was in the hospice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospice had some private rooms and some two-person rooms. Initially Eve was in a two-person room but the other bed was empty. The next day, I think, a private room became available and, with my encouragement, Eve was moved there. In both rooms there was a reclining chair for me to sleep in, so I was able to spend the nights with Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospice was a good, supportive place, with little of the bustle and intrusiveness usually associated with being in the hospital. All of the staff seemed to be doing their best to be kind and helpful. It was a comfort to me to have Eve there and to be relieved of the responsibility of deciding what was best for her care. After the anxieties of Friday, Saturday seemed calm. Because it was the weekend, the regular hospice doctors were not there. The hospice space was shared by another clinic &amp;#8212; a pain clinic I think &amp;#8212; and one of their doctors came around to look at Eve and adjust her morphine. One of the nurses explained to me that on Monday they would do an assessment of Eve&amp;#8217;s condition and make a plan for her, either to keep her in the hospice or to send her home once her condition was stabilized (the emphasis in hospice programs is generally on home care, with in-patient care only when needed).  It seemed to me unlikely that Eve would be sent home.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday evening, when Eve appeared to be resting comfortably, we received an unexpected visit from Susan Stowens, who stayed and talked with me for some time. I don&amp;#8217;t remember our conversation, except that I talked with her about funeral arrangements, told her that Eve wished to be cremated, and that, although we would have a memorial service sometime in the future, I didn&amp;#8217;t plan for any ceremony right after Eve&amp;#8217;s death (I was guided in this by how Eve&amp;#8217;s family had handled her father&amp;#8217;s death six months before). She gave me a list of funeral and cremation services that she recommended, and took the time to discuss each of them with me. The top of the list was a basically one-person service provided by Paul Giffone. Susan said that she had had one problem with him (he had been unresponsive in some way, as far as I remember) but that otherwise he was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime over the weekend, I also received a visit in Eve&amp;#8217;s room from the hospice chaplain. He may have been Catholic, I don&amp;#8217;t remember for sure but think that he was addressed as &amp;#8216;Father.&amp;#8217; He seemed to be a kind, open person. I told him that Eve was Buddhist and declined his offer of spiritual support, but I did ask him a practical question that had been on my mind. Perhaps prompted by having seen &amp;#8216;Jules and Jim&amp;#8217; some fifty years before and having been deeply impressed by the closing scene in which Jules, alone, attends the cremation of Jim and Catherine, I had been thinking about attending Eve&amp;#8217;s cremation, but I&amp;#8217;d been unable to learn anything about doing so. I asked the chaplain if he knew anything about it, and he said he did not but that he could ask a Japanese colleague, Issan, who was a Buddhist chaplain. He used his cell phone to call Issan, explained my question to him, and then let him talk to me directly. Issan told me that he had arranged for such a viewing once but that both he and the family for whom he had arranged it had found it deeply disturbing, so he did not recommend it. He said that they had found both the crematorium itself and the proceedings to be plainly functional and not at all spiritually satisfying. I thanked him for his help but did not mention to him that what he described was just what I was hoping for: something plain, direct, and unadorned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, after Eve had given up her quest for a Buddhist guru, T had been Eve&amp;#8217;s informal spiritual advisor.  Eve saw T, I think, as having a deep knowledge and feeling for Tibetan Buddhism, but not being at all doctrinaire about it.  When Eve was first reading about Tibetan Buddhism, and was still expecting to die very soon, she requested that a Buddhist monk be present to read the Tibetan Book of the Dead to her in the days after she died.  But in the following years, Eve gave up the search for a formal personal teacher and became more comfortable with her own eclectic, non-doctrinaire approach to Buddhism.  She also lost interest in finding a Buddhist community (sangha) to belong to.  So there was no community on which to draw when she died.  While she was in the hospice, I started looking again at the Tibetan Book of the Dead and found what seemed to me a great deal of negativity &amp;#8212; a dwelling on the scariness of the after-death situation &amp;#8212; that I was not sure if Eve would have sympathy for or would still want read to her.  So I asked T about whether such reading was necessary.  T, as I remember, said no, that her guru did not require it and that she did not know of its often being done.  She did say that there was a text called the Sukavati that, in her experience, was often read after death, and she kindly found a copy of it for me.  The other text that I have most relied on is the Heart Sutra.  It was a key Buddhist text for Eve.  She wrote about it, both in prose and in her poetry, and had attended a teaching of several days by HH the Dalai Lama that focused on the concept of emptiness and included a group recitation of the Heart Sutra.  Thus these two texts were the ones that I used in my private observances when Eve was cremated and when I scattered her ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike and Jon came to visit Eve in the late morning on Saturday and sat with her for a while. Then, overlapping with them, Rita and Elaine came in from Queens for a visit. Later in the afternoon Eve&amp;#8217;s friends Mary Campbell and Mandy arrived. They stayed a long time, well into the evening, and I took the opportunity to walk home and do some chores (and also, as far as I remember, to send some emails). In the evening I made some phone calls to schedule visits for the next day because a number of people wanted to see Eve and I didn&amp;#8217;t want them to arrive all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime overnight on Saturday, Eve&amp;#8217;s condition changed again. Her pattern of breathing changed. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I remember accurately now, but it seemed less relaxed, maybe with a sharper intake; and Eve&amp;#8217;s eyes seemed to be not quite closed all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning was a stream of visitors, all dear friends, all kindly arriving when I had suggested. Andy and Meredith came. Then Josh and Marsha. Then Joe and Mark. I mentioned Eve&amp;#8217;s changed condition to Josh and he said that he had seen a similar condition in his father for the day or two before his death. Later on Sunday morning the weekend doctor came by on his rounds. I told him what Josh had said and asked if he agreed. He said yes. This was deeply upsetting, but I&amp;#8217;m grateful to Josh and the doctor for telling me because it helped prepare me for what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening Mandy returned. Again I took the opportunity to go home for a little while, perhaps to send some emails. Mandy said she would call me if there was any change in Eve&amp;#8217;s condition. Mandy was catching the late bus back to Washington DC and I wanted to return before she left. As I was returning I tried to call my sister Edith to tell her what was happening but the connection was bad so we agreed to talk the following day. As far as I recall, I returned to the hospice about 9:30pm and Mandy left about 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night nurse was Delia. It occurred to me to walk down the hall to her station and ask her, with difficulty, whether, if Eve died during the night, I could have some time to sit with her. She was very sympathetic and agreed, I think, to about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 10:30pm Delia came in to check on Eve and to adjust her medications.  Eve&amp;#8217;s breathing seemed labored. Delia spoke to Eve, telling her that I was there, and that it was OK for her to go now. That she could let go if she wanted and that it would be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Delia did was very helpful to me. I think she somehow gave me the idea that I could talk to Eve (I can&amp;#8217;t remember now if I was talking to Eve before &amp;#8211; I think I must have been &amp;#8211; but not so openly and freely). After Delia left, I sat by Eve&amp;#8217;s bed, holding her hand and talking to her. I was saying much the same things over and over. I told her how good she was, how much good she had done for so many people, that everything would be OK, that she could go whenever she wanted, and over and over how much I loved her and how wonderful she had been to me. What a sweet Panda! What a lovely little Panda! After a while Eve&amp;#8217;s breathing slowed and the time between breaths increased.  She would draw in a breath and then some time would pass before another. She drew in a breath and more time passed. She didn&amp;#8217;t breath again. After some moments I realized that she was dead.  A little while later I looked at my watch. It was 11:25pm on Sunday, April 12.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat with Eve, talking to her, holding her hand. Around midnight an attendant came in and saw that Eve was dead. Delia came too. Then they went away to find a physician to make the official pronouncement of Eve&amp;#8217;s death. Maybe half an hour later they came back with a physician and asked me to step outside for a while. They cleaned and arranged Eve&amp;#8217;s body, taking out the IV and putting on a fresh gown, and the physician filled out the necessary forms. Thus Eve&amp;#8217;s official time of death is early in the morning on Monday, April 13. After they were done I came back in and sat with Eve again. I called Elaine (waking her up of course) with the news of Eve&amp;#8217;s death. I also called and left a detailed message for Paul Giffone, whose cremation service had been recommended to me by Susan Stowens.  Around 2:00am I gathered up my things, said goodbye to Eve, and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on Monday morning, I received a call from a woman at the eye bank to ask for the donation of Eve&amp;#8217;s corneas. I was reluctant myself, but I had no doubt what Eve would have wanted, so I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around noon, Rita came to Eve&amp;#8217;s studio. We had lunch and talked a while. Then we took a taxi to the Vamoose bus stop near Penn Station, and I helped her onto the bus. She returned to Bethesda, where a friend met her at the bus stop and took her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Giffone also came over on Monday and we discussed the plans for Eve&amp;#8217;s cremation. I asked him about attending (&amp;#8216;witnessing&amp;#8217;) and he said that was permitted for a small additional fee. I told him that I would like to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday April 15th I rented a car and drove to the Liberty Grove Crematorium in New Jersey. It was a simple place, rather industrial in character, but very tidy and clean. After a while Paul Giffone arrived (with a station wagon I think) with Eve&amp;#8217;s body in a plain cardboard coffin which he unloaded with the help of the man at the crematorium. Together they placed the coffin on a kind of gurney. At my request they opened the coffin so that I could see Eve one last time. I had brought a Tibetan necklace of colorful felt beads that I had bought for Eve at the Rubin Museum&amp;#8217;s holiday craft fair the previous December and that Eve was happy with. I placed the necklace inside the coffin, resting on Eve&amp;#8217;s chest. Then they closed the coffin, wheeled the gurney up to the door of the furnace, and moved the coffin onto a kind of conveyor belt which carried it into the depths of the furnace. They closed the door of the furnace and went into the adjacent office leaving me alone, as I had asked. I don&amp;#8217;t remember how long I was there &amp;#8211; maybe an hour or so. I read aloud the text of the Sukavati, which T had given me. Then I recited the mantra of the Heart Sutra many times. At some point in my recital I had a distinct feeling, with no real sensory component, of a kind of expansion emanating from the furnace into the room and beyond. It seemed to me as though something was being released from Eve&amp;#8217;s body, which was no longer there, and expanding into space. It felt to me like an expanding bubble that would just keep on expanding and expanding. It wasn&amp;#8217;t an experience I had anticipated or would attempt to explain but the feeling of liberation was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while the two men came back into the room and told me it was time for me to leave. They didn&amp;#8217;t explain but I knew that it was time for them to remove Eve&amp;#8217;s ashes from the furnace and to grind down any remaining large fragments of bone. The grinder was visible on the side of the room. I went outside. There was a small old Jewish cemetery there and I wandered around in it for half an hour or so taking some photos. Then, as I had been instructed, I went back to the door of the crematorium and was given a box containing Eve&amp;#8217;s ashes and the certificate of her cremation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove back to Manhattan by way of Staten Island, stopping there at the Jacques Marchais museum of Tibetan art, a place that Eve and I had often talked of visiting someday. I toured the house and sat for a while in the garden, and then I drove home. I put the box with Eve&amp;#8217;s ashes on the table next to my reading chair, making a sort of shrine to which I added some photos and from time to time other things such as flowers or incense.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine days following April 13, T, Claudia, and Claudia&amp;#8217;s friend John Sell, who is, like T, a Tibetan Buddhist, came over to my studio. John conducted the forty-nine day ceremony and we all recited the words with him. At the end we put a small photo of Eve on a chopstick, like a little sail on a mast, and burned it, symbolizing, I suppose, her release from physical existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the evening before the ceremony, close to the time that was actually forty-nine days after Eve&amp;#8217;s death, I had another experience, difficult to explain, but important to me. Perhaps I can write about it someday, but I expect to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;###&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept Eve&amp;#8217;s ashes by my side for over sixteen months. On Sunday, August 22, 2010, I flew to San Francisco with her ashes and drove to a cottage I had rented in Bolinas. On Tuesday, I drove to Sausalito, where I had engaged a boat (the &amp;#8216;Blue Runner&amp;#8217;) that offers the service of scattering ashes (as well as tours and sports fishing). The captain took the boat out under the Golden Gate Bridge to a quiet place along the northern shore of the Golden Gate. The deck hand told me it was time, whenever I was ready, and retired to the cabin. I first threw into the ocean a few fragrant yellow flowers from a large bush outside my cottage in Bolinas. Then  I scattered Eve&amp;#8217;s ashes. The boat was continuing to move slowly west, and the breeze carried the ashes out. As I slowly poured them out of the plastic bag, the breeze carried them in the air making a delicate grayish white plume a dozen or so feet long. I read aloud the Heart Sutra and recited its mantra many times. The boat circled slowed around and I told the deck hand that I was done. We returned to Sausalito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive back from Sausalito, I stopped at Muir Woods. It was a special place for Eve and me. I had taken her there in June of 1968 when she had come to visit me at my home in Berkeley before the Telluride Convention at Deep Springs. I walked among the redwoods, and many tourists, for a couple of hours. Then I drove on to Bolinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was our 41st wedding anniversary &amp;#8212; August 24, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>March 5, 2015: Fifth Annual Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Memorial Lecture at Boston University</title>
    <link href="/blog/Mahmood-BU-Lecture.html"/>
    <updated>2015-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/Mahmood-BU-Lecture</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Professor Saba Mahmood spoke on &amp;#8220;Moral Injury and Muhammed&amp;#8217;s Cartoons: Thinking Reparatively with Eve Sedgwick.&amp;#8221; Mahmood is Associate Professor of Sociocultural Anthropology at the University of California Berkeley. As in years past, the Boston University Gender + Sexuality Studies Group organized the lecture. Here is their description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Taking its cue from Eve Sedgwick, this talk offers a &amp;#8216;reparative reading&amp;#8217; of the ongoing struggle over the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed in Europe. Rather than read these debates as a standoff between religious taboos and secular freedoms, Mahmood unpacks the distinct epistemological and interpretive stakes at the heart of such conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Professor Mahmood’s work focuses on the interchange between religious and secular politics in postcolonial societies with special attention to issues of embodiment, cultural hermeneutics, law, and gender/sexuality.  Her work is best known for its interrogation of liberal assumptions about the proper boundary between ethics and politics, freedom and unfreedom, the religious and the secular, and agency and submission. She is the author of &lt;em&gt;The Politics of Piety&lt;/em&gt; (2nd edition, 2011) and, with Talal Assad, Wendy Brown, and Judith Butler, &lt;em&gt;Is Critique Secular? Blasphemy, Injury, and Free Speech&lt;/em&gt; (2009).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video of Professor Mahmood&amp;#8217;s talk will be posted on BU&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/honoringeve/&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;Honoring Eve&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New Writing About Eve Sedgwick</title>
    <link href="/blog/new-writing-about-eve.html"/>
    <updated>2015-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/new-writing-about-eve</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two new essays about Eve Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s critical writing have recently appeared. Professor Anne-Lise François&amp;#8217;s essay &amp;#8220;Late Exercises in Minimal Affirmatives&amp;#8221; appears in &lt;em&gt;Theory Aside&lt;/em&gt;, a collection edited by Jason Potts and Daniel Stout (Duke 2014). In her essay, François discusses &amp;#8220;the lateral movement by which in their late work Barthes and Sedgwick set aside the burden of discontented, perfective energies and leave off prying, suspicious efforts to uncover concealed truth. They prefer instead a form of aesthetic engagement that moves laterally, arranging its materials side by side&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221; In her epigraph, François quotes Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;#8220;Beside is an interesting preposition&amp;#8230;because there is nothing very dualistic about it; a number of elements may lie alongside one another, though not an infinity of them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan A. Allan&amp;#8217;s essay &amp;#8220;Falling in Love with Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick&amp;#8221; appears in a special &amp;#8220;Queer/Affect&amp;#8221; issue of &lt;em&gt;Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature&lt;/em&gt;. Allan writes: &amp;#8220;What does it mean to love a writer? This essay explores a number of writers and critics who have expressed love for Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. I argue that love affords another model for thinking through questions of influence, particularly a theory of influence informed by queer theory and affect studies.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would be grateful if readers let us know about new work related to Eve Sedgwick. Please contact us at  &lt;a class=&quot;email&quot;&gt;info[a]evekosofskysedgwick.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Another newly published essay by Eve Sedgwick</title>
    <link href="/blog/Theory-Aside.html"/>
    <updated>2015-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/Theory-Aside</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Writing the History of Homophobia,&amp;#8221; a previously unpublished manuscript from Eve Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s archive, has now been published in  &lt;em&gt;Theory Aside&lt;/em&gt;. This collection, edited by Jason Potts and Daniel Stout, is published by Duke University Press. Eve&amp;#8217;s text is thought to have been given as a talk at Amherst College, where she taught from 1984 to 1988. She describes the impossibility of learning, for example, about Oscar Wilde’s homosexuality from the Encyclopedia Britannica of her childhood if one doesn’t know about it already. She takes this as an emblem of “the extremely elusive and maddeningly plural ways in which cultures and their various institutions efface and alter sexual meaning.” She goes on to say that “at least for Western society of the last two millennia, the many complicated paths by which, as we have said, sexual meaning is falsified, denied, and altered, all lead homosexuals to much the same thorny and difficult place.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>March 20, 2014: Fourth Annual Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick Memorial Lecture at Boston University</title>
    <link href="/blog/Berlant-BU-Lecture.html"/>
    <updated>2014-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/Berlant-BU-Lecture</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Boston University Gender + Sexuality Studies Group has announced that Lauren Berlant will give this year’s lecture, “Sex in the Event of Happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our theories of the historical event tend to take the shape of trauma and catastrophe.  What if we saw in sex the kind of event that structures our relation to history, intimacy, and sociality? Reading with &lt;em&gt;Last Tango in Paris&lt;/em&gt; (Bertolucci, 1972), thinking about sexual revolution, and contesting the desexualization of so much queer theory, this lecture poses questions about where the sexual revolution went awry and what’s left for sexual optimism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlant is the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor, Chicago University, and her most recent book, &lt;em&gt;Sex, or the Unbearable&lt;/em&gt; is a dialogue with Lee Edelman (Duke 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture will take place at 5:00 pm in the Florence and Chafetz Hillel House, 213 Bay State Road, Boston. It is free and open to the public. A reception will follow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A Valentine’s Day celebration of Sedgwick’s poetry</title>
    <link href="/blog/FATA-York.html"/>
    <updated>2014-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/FATA-York</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The University of York has announced two events that continue a tradition of celebrations of Eve’s work begun last year with their conference on &lt;em&gt;Tendencies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To celebrate Queer History Month, Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day, and the twentieth anniversary of the publication of &lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt;, the Centre for Modern Studies is delighted to host an afternoon soirée to discuss Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick as a poet. The afternoon will feature a number of short position papers on different aspects of Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s poetry, including &lt;em&gt;A Dialogue on Love&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event, titled “Fat Art Thin Art: Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick as a Poet,” will be held on &lt;br /&gt;
Friday, February 14, from 1:00pm to 5:30pm in The Treehouse, Berrick Saul Building, on The University of York campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be preceded by an evening of poetry titled “A Lovely Dialogue: Critics and Poets, Friends and Fans” on Thursday, February 13, from 6:00pm to 7:30pm at the same location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The evening will include a reading by Mary Baines Campbell, the author of two books of poems, &lt;em&gt;The World, The Flesh and Angels&lt;/em&gt; (Beacon, 1989) and &lt;em&gt;Trouble: Poems&lt;/em&gt; (Carnegie Mellon, 2003), as well as a leading scholar of Renaissance and Early Modern culture. It will also include a cast reading of Sedgwick’s Dr. Seussian queer bedtime story for children, &amp;#8216;Pandas in Trees.&amp;#8217;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both events are free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served. For further information, please contact  jason.edwards@york.ac.uk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newly published essay by Eve Sedgwick</title>
    <link href="/blog/Censorship-and-Homophobia-Chapbook.html"/>
    <updated>2014-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sarah McCarry&amp;#8217;s press, Guillotine, has published a chapbook of a 1990 essay by Eve Sedgwick. In her introduction, Sarah writes: &amp;#8220;I found this essay among her papers, which, over the last few years, I&amp;#8217;ve been helping &amp;#8230; to archive, and the initial thrill of coming across a paper of Eve&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8212; partially handwritten, cut-and-pasted together in places, a sheaf of papers that felt as alive as if she&amp;#8217;d just set them down moments earlier&amp;#8212; that had never before been published soon gave way to the even greater joy of realizing what an extraordinary, beautifully-written and still-relevant essay it was.&amp;#8221; Sarah is calling the untitled manuscript &lt;em&gt;[Censorship &amp;amp; Homophobia]&lt;/em&gt;. Handsomely crafted, the chapbooks have letter-pressed covers, and are hand sewn. A limited special edition includes a two-color, letter-pressed broadsheet with a quotation from the essay. The  &lt;a href=&quot;http://souslespaves.bigcartel.com/product/guillotine-series-5-censorship-homophobia&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;chapbook&lt;/a&gt;, and special edition &lt;a href=&quot;http://souslespaves.bigcartel.com/product/guillotine-series-5-special-edition&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt; are available from &lt;a href=&quot;http://souslespaves.bigcartel.com/&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;Guillotine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our website is now hosting the papers that were given at &lt;i&gt;Tendencies at Twenty&lt;/i&gt;. The symposium, organized by Jason Edwards, was held at the University of York this past Valentine’s Day to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the publication of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s book &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;. Each paper at the symposium discussed one (or in a couple of cases two) of the book&amp;#8217;s chapters, including such well-known essays of Sedgwick’s as “How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay,” “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl,” and “Queer and Now.” The symposium papers, in addition to offering critical readings of the chapters, are often deeply personal, reflecting the impact of Sedgwick’s work on lives of the authors. The symposium papers are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://evekosofskysedgwick.net/conferences/conferences.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tendencies at Twenty &lt;/i&gt;was an interdisciplinary afternoon symposium to celebrate the birthday of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;ground-breaking, paradigm-shifting, multi-generic, queer-theoretical masterpiece. Timed also to celebrate Valentine’s Day and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LGBTIQ&lt;/span&gt; History month, the seminar saw speakers and participants coming from Leeds, Dundee, Manchester, Oxford, Norwich, Newcastle, London, Brighton and Manhattan. The day comprised three panels, ‘Queer Tutelage’, ‘Crossing of Discourses’ and ‘Across Genders and Sexualities’ with each panel dealing with a single section of the book, and each five-to-ten minute position paper dealing with a single chapter of the book, or in the case of the first and last papers, with two, closely related chapters of the book. The speakers came from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives, including English and Related Literature, Film Studies, Art History, and German Studies, and I encouraged each to respond in any register or genre that they chose. Each paper, referred to by title, is given on a separate page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epigraph for my paper comes from a song by Anthony and the Johnsons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='blocktext'&gt;One day I’ll grow up and I’ll be a beautiful woman,&lt;br /&gt;
One day I’ll grow up and I’ll be a beautiful girl,&lt;br /&gt;
One day I’ll grow up and I’ll be a beautiful woman,&lt;br /&gt;
One day I’ll grow up and I’ll be a beautiful girl;&lt;br /&gt;
But today, I am a child, today I am a boy.(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt; 1) Antony and the Johnsons, ‘For Today I am a Boy’, &lt;i&gt;I am a Bird Now &lt;/i&gt;(Rough Trade, 2005).&lt;/span&gt;Who wouldn’t want to grow up to be Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick? When &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was 20, in 1992, when I first saw Eve give a paper, ‘Is the Rectum Straight: Identification and Identity in &lt;i&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/i&gt;’; and, certainly, a year later, when &lt;i&gt;Tendencies &lt;/i&gt;came out, I was all about Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Eve is still who I want to be if I ever grow up. But lately I have been realising, with more care and compassion, parts of me are still a motherless child, parts an abandoned boy. Other tendencies within me are, though, perhaps currently more queerly visible and clearly audible to you, if not quite, distinct. Because, as my t-shirt suggests, “everyone knows that I’m a lesbian”, right? And, as I re-read both ‘T-Times’ and ‘Queer and Now’, in preparation for this paper, I began to understand better what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to that, it might be worth acknowledging something else that is characteristic of me, when it comes to reading Eve. It takes me an insanely long time, sometimes years, sometimes more, to hear her most obvious puns. For example, I’m not sure that, much before these last weeks, I ever heard in the title, ‘T Times’, anything but an allusion to the queer, cross-gender-identifications Eve begins &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; by thinking about, as manifested in gay men wearing dyke t-shirts and lesbians wearing faggot t’s.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt; 2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, xii.&lt;/span&gt; I’m not sure I ever heard the title as a pun on tea times, as in the regular, quotidian time for a cuppa, in my case, or a glass of iced tea, in Eve’s; or as a reference to the T, for Trans, in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LGBTIQ&lt;/span&gt; politics, theory and activism. It also took Victoria Coulson, who I learn from constantly, to point out to me that there also may be a golf allusion here, as in t-ing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inability to hear the T of trans&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; for a long time, was partly to do with the comparatively more recent emergence of trans theory, in relation to the dominant queer theoretical lenses of the early to mid-nineties, when &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; came out. But it still requires, for me personally, more explanation because, for about as long as I can remember, I’ve been about as cross-gender and, then, cross-sexuality identified as a gay boy could be. Indeed, almost all of my most formative influences, from my adolescence forwards, derive from a viscerally intense,(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) I’m tacitly alluding here to sentences from the ‘Project 2’ subsection of ‘Queer and Now’ (&lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;14).&lt;/span&gt; highly inventive and speculative cross-identification with lesbian women and culture, as I inferred, imagined, and later came to know them and it, and as I discovered them and it to be a source of relish and knowledge; of emotional, intellectual and political sustenance and succour; and of artistic and relational skill, challenge, demand, experimentation, speculation, daring, dignity and pride. And it doesn’t risk exaggeration to say that, as a boy coming from a family which didn’t really read or own books, I genuinely thought, aged around 11 to 13, that the literary canon comprised writing by no-one but feminist and lesbian women, as found in the pages of books published by Virago and the Women’s Press, thanks to my then-not-out best friend Alison Farrell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when it came to my musical education. After all, how would I have been, and who, if I hadn’t discovered, in 1986, Suzanne Vega’s eponymous first album; or, two years later, Joni Mitchell’s &lt;i&gt;Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm&lt;/i&gt;; Ladies from the Canon, and from Manhattan, that I loved &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; women and &lt;i&gt;as a&lt;/i&gt; woman, and still do? And that was before my then friend Nina Diamond sent me the first two albums by Ani Difranco, in that queerly promising summer of 1993, the same English summer of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if, for me at least, it makes a good deal of sense to out myself as a lesbian, a lesbian-feminist man or a lesbian identified man; as well as a multiply-gendered and oriented queer and trans person; and, more recently, as a pussy, cock, and ass lover, who’s putting the animals back into sodomy, the bestiality back into queer theory; if, then, for me, the &lt;i&gt;pull&lt;/i&gt; of lesbian separatism is only too clear, I find myself increasingly needing to explain, to myself and my shrink, the even greater &lt;i&gt;push&lt;/i&gt;, at a crucial moment, in the early to mid-80s, away from identifying myself as a gay man,in spite of this being a period in which so many artists were suddenly making formerly invisible possibilities visible and audible. And here I’m grateful to Alex Beaumont for reminding me that the mid-1980s was a telling televisual epoch, on the newly founded Channel Four, where I first found a way and excuses to see &lt;i&gt;My Beautiful Launderette &lt;/i&gt;around 1985; Derek Jarman’s &lt;i&gt;Caravaggio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Last of England &lt;/i&gt;and Merchant Ivory’s &lt;i&gt;Maurice &lt;/i&gt;a year or so later; and when I heard the Pet Shop Boys’ first album &lt;i&gt;Please &lt;/i&gt;in 1986, which helped me imprint onto  that eminently receptive screen for queer projections: silent, musical, fashionable, adjacent, beautiful Chris Lowe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also a period in which, somewhere in a world I couldn’t yet imagine from my boarding school in Market Rasen, called, was it?, Brighton or London, Eve was delivering, at a conference on the ‘Poetics of Anger’, a deliciously perverse paper called ‘A Poem is Being Written’, of which more later, to the delighted ears of another subsequent chum, Simon Watney, who was dedicated his time to his related life’s work of making so many queer lives feel more possible and plausible, desirable and valuable, liveable and loveable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why, then, in spite of Merchant and Ivory, Simon and Eve, and Neil, Chris and Derek’s best efforts, didn’t I come, in the section-28 context of rural Lincolnshire, in the mid-eighties to identify, in any straightforward way, as a gay man? The answer is, I’ve come to realise, these last weeks, because, in the fractured intricacies of the stained glass window which is my subjectivity, for every shard of beautiful, identity-constituting lesbian glass, there’s an identity-shattering lead line of male homophobic dis-identification, disavowal and violently enforced foreclosure.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) My metaphors here derive from any number of illuminating conversations with Jasmine Allen. &lt;/span&gt; After all, how the hell was I supposed to want to grow up to be either a man or a gay man, at De Aston School in 1986, when the first two boys I genuinely loved, and who I told, didn’t utter another word to me for more than a decade, in the first instance, and, in the second case, never spoke to me again. And if, in the atrocity story and obituary which is my autobiography, Jason, the one out boy at my school, was raped with a stick by his immediate male peers to teach him a lesson he would never forget? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recently integrated memory explains a lot, to me, why I tend to be on team &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, as well as&lt;i&gt; No Future&lt;/i&gt;,(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Lee Edelman, &lt;i&gt;No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive &lt;/i&gt;(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2004).&lt;/span&gt; when it comes to those queer kids Eve describes, and is similarly haunted by, in ‘Queer and Now’, who are “two to three times likelier to attempt suicide, and to accomplish it, than others”; and those “minority queer adolescents” who are “at even more risk”.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 1.&lt;/span&gt; It also perhaps explains why I remember 1993 so vividly, when I found &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, for the first time, in the women’s studies section of Heffers, the big bookshop in Cambridge; and for anyone too young to remember life before the internet, it’s hard to explain quite how much more exciting it was, back then, to discover texts on bookshelves, without warning or the benefit of search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, the “anguish” I felt as an eleven year old, when boys and men had taken “something from me I didn’t even know that I had”, was far from “outgrown”, and, if “remembered”, certainly not yet understood, incorporated or digested.(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) The quotations here combine a poem by Emily Dickinson Sedgwick cites on the first page of ‘Queer and Now’ (1) and lines from Ani Difranco’s ‘Letter to a John’, particularly the live ‘Letter to a John/Tamburitza Lingua’ mash up version from &lt;i&gt;So Much Shouting, So Much Laughter &lt;/i&gt;(Righteous Babe, 2002).&lt;/span&gt; But it does, at least retrospectively, explain to me why, if other, more straightforward, and less imaginative and self conscious, people were baffled and irritated at Eve’s coming out, in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, as a gay man, it made perfect sense to me. Indeed, Eve may have been the first gay man I ever really loved and trusted, as an adult gay man, and no-one else made wanting to be gay, for me, then, not a baffled, repressed, conflicted, poignant tendency, but a pleasurable relational and inhabitable possibility. And my inner gay man wasn’t the only person to find themselves picked up, looked at, recognised, ravished, initiated, loved and held afterwards in the women’s studies section that day by that beautiful woman with a flushed face, punk-dyke’s crew-cut, and centred, mindful subject’s fearless, generous gaze. Also at therapy, or should that be the seminar, march, party, encounter group and orgy, in short, also at &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; was my equally amazingly graced and graciously amazed masochist, inner lesbian feminist, fat kid, mortal uncle, masturbator, bodhisattva, and my academically ambitious would be professor; my theatrical, queer-theoretical would be performance poet and creative writer. Oh, I was &lt;i&gt;found&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my lost, unloved little kid, who would otherwise never have believed, could start to feel that, farther along, the road would widen, the air brighten; that in the more cosmopolitan atmosphere out beyond provincial Market Rasen, at West Sixteenth Street in Manhattan, was a world, Eve and Hal’s, where someday I’d be welcomed, fed, held, listened to, seen, loved and understood. Elsewhere, in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, as we shall see, Eve asks how to raise your kids gay? Pretty easy I’d say.Don’t abandon them, aged eleven, in a Victorian boarding school and let their peers rape them with a stick. Show them &lt;i&gt;My Beautiful Launderette.&lt;/i&gt; Play them the Pet Shop Boys &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;. Most importantly, give them a copy of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Privilege of Unknowing: Diderot’s &lt;i&gt;The Nun’&lt;/i&gt; begins with a familiar and instructive metaphor, used in a defamiliarising way. If knowledge is not power but the “&lt;i&gt;magnetic field&lt;/i&gt; of power”(1)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 24.&lt;/span&gt; then what we are being asked to envision, even at this early stage in the chapter, is a powerful force created by the relationship between polarised concepts, also the vigour with which these concepts attract and repel each other, also the capturedness of the objects that surround them within a closed system. Magnetic field lines are circular, directional, and infinitely large, so the extent of magnetic influence is both immeasurable and knowable (in the sense that we have the conceptual vocabulary to describe infinity if not measure it). That a metaphor appropriated from a science we all learn early, and whose terms already order our understanding of sexual behaviour, launches the endeavour at the heart of this chapter, should perhaps come as no surprise. As Sedgwick puts it, a process of coming to “know” how “to interpret sexual meanings” involves making “acrobatic leaps of yet unearned identification consolidated by recoils of a more violent repudiation”.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 47.&lt;/span&gt; Arguably a metaphor which is perhaps the ultimate popular expression of the effects of polarisation, and which simultaneously implies the mobility of poles and their capacity to shift, moving the apparently fixed location of concepts such as ‘north’ and ‘south’ with them, is already at the heart of the deconstructive project. As is the sense that the purpose of that project is to identify the forces by which meaning is created and gesture towards the potentialities which are occluded by that productive and reproductive process. It is obvious that the language of the chapter is fascinated by, and continually returns to, the terms of this initial metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no expert on Sedgwick, or on deconstruction, but it seems to me that the jouissance of Sedgwick’s critical enterprise is evident not just in her application of methodologies which cause us, with a particular eye on sexuality, to look anew at the conceptual history of literature and literary criticism and to focus our attention on the dangerous dualisms that have tended to structure it. In her work as I understand it, there is simultaneously an implication that these dualisms are inevitably upheld, perhaps even created anew, by the critical methodologies available to us. This is not a particularly interesting thought in itself, and may even seem a reprehensible observation to make about someone whose investment in the activism of the page is so obvious. Two things interest me about it, though. One is the possibility that such an implication might be invigorating or a source of pleasure. The other is the counter-pull created by my desire not to see her work as self-defeating. When she spoke here at York in 2007, she made a remark which I can recall only partially, about people who are skilled in language, and the power that brings, and how one might want to move away from that position of privilege in language, towards one which does not hold such dangers and which might offer other ways of coming to terms with, or submitting oneself to, forces beyond our influence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as well as thinking of language as discourse I would like to think about it in more literal terms. It must be important that this chapter begins not only with the metaphor of a magnetic field, but also with a conversation between M Mitterand and Mr Reagan. What this example illustrates, in a very obvious way, is the privilege ignorance affords, in contrast with a more conventional understanding of privilege as a function of &lt;i&gt;knowledge&lt;/i&gt;. (From a sociolinguistic perspective, one might argue that what it &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; illustrates is not so much the power &lt;i&gt;not knowing&lt;/i&gt; French affords Mr Reagan as the power he gains through being a native speaker of a globally dominant language—but no matter). At any rate this example, or metaphor, becomes strikingly enigmatic when viewed in the larger context of the chapter’s focus on a French text in translation. What is significantly absent from the Mitterand-Reagan conversation—but present, if rather quietly—in the English version(s) of the French text the chapter presents to us, is the interpreter or the translator, the bilingual for whom speaking in either language presents no particular disadvantage. This may seem even more significant when we consider that translation plays such an important part in the original semiotic discovery that because languages are different from each other, there can only be an arbitrary relationship between words and things. Why is a figure so central to the semiotic project omitted from the scene which gets us thinking about ignorance (or ignorances), understood in a deconstructive way, as acts of power? And why is this figure effectively effaced by Sedgwick’s discussion of &lt;i&gt;La Religieuse&lt;/i&gt; (except where the translator is also the writer of an offending introduction to the work)? Why, furthermore, does she consistently refer to the novella by its French title, as if it were not a work in translation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also puzzled as to why the urbane Dr Sedgwick does not know the eighteenth-century French word for “lesbian”.(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;45.&lt;/span&gt; Is she claiming the privilege of ignorance? Does she mean to spur us to find out for ourselves? Did such a word not exist, although what it described existed both in the form of Suzanne and her Mother Superior, and in the fears of the confessors and patriarchs who seek to prevent Suzanne gaining the words to describe it herself? Sedgwick’s apparent signposting of her ignorance of this word seems all the more perplexing when Suzanne is apparently taken to task for “refusing ever to allow anyone to attach a name to anything”.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 45.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only answer I can propose is that Sedgwick does not want the role of translator, perhaps because what translators and editors say about this text is so suspect. Or perhaps because to be a translator must mean being painfully aware of the habits—ethical, conceptual, epistemological—that &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; survive translation as well as those that don’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a less pessimistic view is possible if we return to the place where we began—with the language of science. One could also think about language here in terms of the boundaries of disciplines and methodologies. One of the things that researchers in the sciences, and researchers in language and culture, could be talking to each other about, is how differently we understand the relationship between language, concepts and phenomena. Also how different our objectives and aspirations are for both language and theory. So, to my husband, who is trained both in language and in the empirical process, the idea that one might stop at the irreconcilable relationship between signified and signifier is quite alien and unintelligible. As is the prospect that an account of the world which stops at that point should call itself a ‘theory’. Science uses metaphor too, obviously—the “field” in “magnetic field” is itself a metaphor which is at times not up to the job. But its inadequacy is not a reason to stop there, so much as to keep looking. Or to entertain a flexible relationship with metaphor whereby two very different conceptualisations—light as waves for example, but also as particles—do not so much delegitimate each other as operate in fluid cooperation. I suppose what I’m suggesting here is that Sedgwick’s use of popular scientific language in the chapter, together with her compliment to M Mitterand for being “urbane”—he is a linguistic polymath who can hold his own in an acquired tongue, even at a disadvantage—might reveal an awareness of a territory that lies beyond the limits of discourse and discourse analysis. Even if it is not, in Sedgwick’s view, available to Suzanne Simonin, the placed called “elsewhere” in which “her desire to survive could operate differently: a place called, in the vocabulary she here recklessly borrows from one side only of her double bind, ‘freedom’”(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 35.&lt;/span&gt; might be available to discourse, or the people who currently live within its walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Tales of the Avunculate: Queer Tutelage in &lt;i&gt;The Importance of Being Earnest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Nichols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-BN.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start, not with &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, but with the text whose work it continues: that is, Sedgwick’s &lt;i&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/i&gt; and in particular its opening paragraph. Often cited, and doubtless familiar to many here, that opening posits&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;that “[A]n understanding of virtually any aspect of modern Western culture must be, not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance to the degree that it does not incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition”.(1)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Epistemology of the Closet &lt;/i&gt;(Berkeley: California University Press, 1990), 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, this suggests that there are many formations in Western epistemology that emerge simultaneously with the punishing homo/heterosexual opposition. Consequently, seemingly unrelated phenomena are imbricated with this sexual knowledge regime. Some of the knowledge structures Sedgwick turns her attention to in her work from this period include, for example, the privileging of the meaningfulness of speech over silence, understandings of addiction in terms of an opposition between voluntarity and compulsion, and strategies for figuring fatness or the fat body. The way culture manages knowledges around these issues, and even knowledges of knowledge itself (as in Sedgwick’s chapter on &lt;i&gt;The Nun &lt;/i&gt;in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;), is mixed up with the particular sexual dispensation in the modern west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another hand, the opening of &lt;i&gt;Epistemology&lt;/i&gt; can be read as a precursor to the now commonplace queer theoretical imperative to do justice to so-called intersectionality. This imperative states that it is not enough to provide analyses along the axes of sexuality, one must include analysis of its intersection with other forms of difference. Sedgwick makes a similar point in ‘Queer and Now’: “a lot of the most exciting recent work around ‘queer’ spins the term outward along dimensions that can’t be subsumed under gender and sexuality at all”. For example: “the ways that race, ethnicity, postcolonial nationality criss-cross with these &lt;i&gt;and other &lt;/i&gt;identity-constituting, identity-fracturing discourses”.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 8-9; original italics.&lt;/span&gt; This has connections with the management of knowledges mentioned above, insofar as knowledges about these minoritarian differences are structured analogously to those that define sexuality. The focus in this second gloss has shifted, however, from, in broad terms, everything being about sexuality, to the inclusion of sexuality as a necessary axis of intersection, as one difference among many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of Sedgwick’s essay, ‘Tales of the Avunculate: Queer Tutelage in &lt;i&gt;The Importance of Being Earnest&lt;/i&gt;’, (which is the chapter I’m supposed to be talking about) the approach is, broadly, the first. In &lt;i&gt;Earnest&lt;/i&gt;, Sedgwick&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;finds an engagement with structures of knowledge about the family. She reads the play against a critical orthodoxy in which it is interpreted as aligning homosexual possibility with the subversion of the Name of the Father. That is, this critical orthodoxy remains indebted to certain theoretical projects—namely psychoanalysis and deconstruction—that in some sense rely for their interventions on an Oedipal process that establishes the authority of the Name of the Father in the first place. This orthodoxy reads the homosexual possibility in the play in relation to either “inversion” or “homo” models of homosexual identity. That is, either in terms of the model of an opposite-gendered soul trapped in one’s body (“inversion”), or the model of relations between people defined as of the same gender (“homo”). Sedgwick argues that Wilde did not gravitate towards either. Rather than offering another argument in relation to these models or to the concept of the Name of the Father, Sedgwick suggests that we look to the ways in which the play draws on different strategies for imagining non-normative sexual desires that obtained in its historical moment and were based on the model of avuncular relations. The play tells us to: “Forget the Name of the Father. Think about your uncles and your aunts”.(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 59.&lt;/span&gt; “Aunt” and “Uncle” are historical terms, Sedgwick writes, for indicating forms of male subjectivity and relation: “aunt” denotes a man of effeminate queenly demeanour, “uncle” an older man’s relation of initiation to a younger man. Focussing on these forms of subjectivity is imagined to avoid reproducing the Oedipal formula based around the Name of the Father. However, Sedgwick wonders if it is right to argue, as she might seem to have been doing, that we need a more elasticated concept of the family, which might include more avuncular-type relations. She concludes, however, that insofar as this approach still uses familial metaphorics, and so still takes place in relation to what she calls the Name of the Family (which she thinks has superseded, but occupies a similar place to, the Name of the Father), it still produces an interpretive limitation. The question that the chapter raises, then, but finally leaves unanswered is: How to think outside the Name of the Family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough; this seems like an important question to ask. It’s not a question I’m going to try to answer here though. (If one did want an answer to this question, one could start with an argument of Michael Lynch’s that Sedgwick cites to the effect that, rather than assimilating queer relations to familial models, we might try to install modes of queer friendship at the heart of our imaginations of relationality).(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 71-72.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I don’t intend to answer this question is because there is another regime with which Sedgwick’s chapter engages, which I’m calling the Name of the Familiar. One of the structures of knowledge that Sedgwick notes is marked by homo/heterosexual definition is, of course, the opposition same/different. I think it’s fair to say that Sedgwick herself never seemed that interested in this particular structure other than in making the observation that modern sexual subjectivities have become organised into two factions: those defined as having a constitutive relation to sameness and those based on a defining difference. Of course, this split is also a hierarchy: difference is valued over sameness. But, as I just mentioned, Sedgwick does not seem to have been interested in the ways in which the manifestations of this value-judgment in seemingly unrelated contexts might also be linked to, or in some way about, the West’s sexual knowledge regime. There is no sense, for example, that it might play out in her own rhetorical moves which seem to borrow from the common sense that difference is always to be preferred. Critics who invoke the Name of the Father to show that Wilde subverts it, through, say, his use of homophonic puns, are convicted of “the same old play with the ‘same’” which subsumes Wilde’s “sexual different-ness”.(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 58.&lt;/span&gt; Because of what Sedgwick feels able to hypothesize about Wilde’s own erotic investment in cross-definitional sexualities, gay possibility in his play cannot be read in relation to sameness: it can’t undergo what Sedgwick calls “the ‘homosexual’ homo-genization that is by now critically routine”.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 58.&lt;/span&gt; The critics she describes are part of “homogenizing modern(ist) interpretive projects”.(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 55.&lt;/span&gt; They are enabled by the “homogenizing heterosexist scientism of homo/hetero”.(8)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;8) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 67.&lt;/span&gt; Therefore it is “urgent” to find “alternative approaches”.(9)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;9) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 55.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By evoking a “same old” “homogenizing” “routine”, Sedgwick relies on the rhetorical force, authority and legitimation that accrue from associating any given idea, political process or interpretive move with sameness, which in the examples I’ve cited manifests in the mode of the familiar. We all know the way we are supposed to react to something figured as more of the same. Queer theory at large has come to rely on a set of similar rhetorical moves. For example, its most paradoxically cherished gesture is to definitively resist the sameness implied by the idea of normativity. The primary problem with normativity is that it leads to inequality (that is, unacceptable difference), yet it is conjured rhetorically as a homogenizing force, a cultural imperative for the imposition of sameness. Sedgwick figures the few critics (although she meaningfully engages only one), against whose accounts of Wilde’s play&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;she seeks to argue, as a “routine”, even though they could easily (even more easily) be read as very different from each other. The formation of a critical “routine”, of course, is a very effective way to discredit one’s interpretive predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is perhaps no surprise that these are the rhetorical strategies on which the chapter relies. After all, it was in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies &lt;/i&gt;that Sedgwick contributed to the process of defining queerness, in its new early-90s academic guise, in an indicative relation to difference. For Sedgwick, “queer” names what cannot be made to “signify monolithically”,(10)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;10) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 8.&lt;/span&gt; spaces where “everything doesn’t mean the same thing!”(11)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;11) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;20.&lt;/span&gt; For her, one of the most exciting things about queerness, as in the second, intersectionalist interpretation of the opening to &lt;i&gt;Epistemology &lt;/i&gt;that I mentioned before, is that it needn’t just be about sexuality: it can (mercifully!) be about different things too. If Sedgwick successfully organises against anything in this chapter it is not the Name of the Family, but instead what I’ve called The Name of the Familiar: a structure of knowing that upholds the value of what seems abjectly, intolerably, even reactionarily tied to sameness. If “family” and “familiar” are etymologically linked in the Latin &lt;i&gt;familiaris&lt;/i&gt;, we might nonetheless want to question the extent to which the family is critiqued or problematized purely on the basis of its familiarity. This is because one of Sedgwick’s most insightful observations helps us to see that the idea of the “same old play with the ‘same’” gets its discrediting rhetorical traction from its relation to the homo/hetero split that is so definitive for modern epistemologies. &lt;/p&gt;

Denis Flannery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-DF.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to conclude by turning again to Lionel Croy as James writes of him in &lt;i&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/i&gt; and to do so in the light of an exchange that takes place between Michael D. Snediker and Sedgwick in their Interview entitled ‘Queer Little Gods’: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MDS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; I love that in Catholicism you can bury your little gods and it’s a totally nonfunerary version of burial, it’s less that they’ve died because they’re little gods but it’s as though they have to do their work underground for some reason. I’ve never quite understood that. The underground St. Anthony versus the Anthony venerated on an altar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EKS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; I haven’t run into that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MDS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; I think St, Anthony is the saint one buries if one is trying to sell one’s house, and he’ll only work if you bury him. You need to bury him in your yard and it will somehow attract buyers. But it’s as though the powers get released in the burial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EKS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;  That’s great.(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Michael D. Snediker and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, ‘Queer Little Gods: A Conversation Between Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Michael D. Snediker, &lt;i&gt;The Massachusetts Review &lt;/i&gt;(49) 1-2,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;212-213.&lt;/span&gt;Sedgwick’s great gesture in ‘Is the Rectum Straight?’ is to take Lionel Croy seriously, to empathize with James’s anxieties about his inadequate representation at the same time that she doesn’t quite buy into James’s frantic articulations of his failures in the Preface to the New York Edition. Taking Lionel Croy seriously as a queer source for the erotic energies of James’s impassioned novel means that, for Sedgwick, Lionel Croy and Milly Theale who, in the novel’s realistic register never ‘meet’, become very much partners in crime. And I use this phrase quite advisedly. For  Sedgwick, Lionel and Milly almost allegorize two modes in which the nineteenth century envisioned homosexuality: “a turn away from the criminal model of homosexuality in this period”, she writes, “seemed as if inevitably to involve a turn toward the medical model: from Lionel to Milly”.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 90.&lt;/span&gt; A little earlier she claims that “One of the most astounding effects in&lt;i&gt; The Wings of the Dove &lt;/i&gt;is the way Milly’s relation to her illness winds up, rhetorically, as an echo precisely of Lionel Croy’s homosexual disgrace”.(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 88.&lt;/span&gt; And she emphasizes how James “framed the two characters in this revisionary relation to one another”.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 89.&lt;/span&gt; Despite this emphasis, Sedgwick gives no attention to the Lionel Croy who doesn’t exactly appear but is nonetheless mentioned towards the novel’s end, in the glowering aftermath of Milly Theale’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionel’s appearance in the house of Marian Condrip, Kate’s sister, is recounted by Kate with a considerable emphasis on the preposition “&lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt;” that I’m contemplating in this essay. Kate tells Densher that Lionel has been in her sister’s house for three days, having arrived suddenly there “in a state which made it impossible not to take him in”. They talk about Lionel a little longer: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;     Densher hesitated. “Do you mean in such want &amp;#8212;?”&lt;br /&gt;
     “No, not of food, of necessary things – not even, so far as his appearance went, of money. He looked as wonderful as ever. But he was – well, in terror.”&lt;br /&gt;
     “In terror of what?”&lt;br /&gt;
     “I don’t know. Of somebody – of something. He wants, he says, to be quiet. But his quietness is awful.”&lt;br /&gt;
     She suffered but he couldn’t not question. “What does he do?”&lt;br /&gt;
     It made Kate herself hesitate. “He cries”.&lt;br /&gt;
     Again, for a moment he hung fire, but he risked it. “What &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; he done?”&lt;br /&gt;
     It made her slowly rise, and they were once more fully face to face. Her eyes held his own and she was paler than she had been. “If you love me – now – don’t ask about father.” (5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Henry James, &lt;i&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/i&gt;, 395.&lt;/span&gt;There are several connections between these two exchanges (Sedgwick’s and Snediker’s, Kate’s and Densher’s), Sedgwick’s reading of the pairing of Lionel and Milly and the preposition ‘in’. Firstly, although ‘in’ as a preposition of occupancy is used here when Kate talks of Marian having to take Lionel in, most of the time it is used to refer to the occupancy of an aberrational state – “in terror”. So, for Snediker, certain kinds of “powers get released in the burial”, but Lionel is described as in the grip of a terrible power. For all that, Lionel, sequestered, Christ-like, for three days is far from ineffectual. “Father’s never ill. He’s a marvel.  He’s only – endless”, Kate claims a bit earlier, conferring on him the power so ostensibly wanting in the recently dead Milly Theale, but ultimately similar to the paralyzing legacy with which James’s novel ends. And Lionel has clearly lost none of his powers to incite questions (Densher “risks” asking, somewhat pointlessly, “What &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; he done”?). And Lionel has lost none of his power to make his thoroughly modern daughter suffer, hesitate and grow pale. There can be no better evidence of Lionel’s ongoing power than the use of silence about him as a bargaining tool, even at this late stage, between Kate and Densher. Along with and as part of his state of terror, Lionel, in Kate’s account, demonstrates an  “awful quietness” – a state of stillness not unlike the quiet of the grave. And the principal active verb she uses of him is “to cry”, which is employed in an unrelenting present tense. One of the key effects noted by David Kurnick of &lt;i&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/i&gt; is what he terms “performative leveling”, which is where characters, even when they have no immediate ties on the plane of realism, or even any ties at all, echo each others’ vocabulary, often through the use of adjectives such as the “wonderful”, and “beautiful”.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) David Kurnick, 215-218.&lt;/span&gt; We might have an instance of this in the passage I’ve just quoted when Kate claims that on arriving at Miriam’s door, Lionel looked “as wonderful as ever”. I wonder if Lionel’s state of terror, his weeping and his taking to his bed for a sepulchral three days can be read, on the plane of performative leveling, as his uncanny response to death of the utterly uncanny Milly Theale? I wonder if his grief might be at the loss of the woman who, in Sedgwick’s reading, completed his being in James’s mighty text? Because it might be right to say that Lionel is “trundled offstage” in favor of Milly as James’s novel goes on.(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 89.&lt;/span&gt; But that very expulsion can also be read as a transformation. Lionel can be said to have &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; Milly, rather than simply be replaced by her. Her death can be said, then, to return him to his former state. And that means that, via Milly’s burial, a power has been released, perhaps resulting in Lionel’s terror. But in a novel where emotions, bodily states and erotic dispositions are nothing, as Sedgwick herself noted, if not contagious, that terror might be said to have spread to Kate and Densher. By being buried in the ground, Milly’s powers, newly released, are manifest in Lionel even as he grieves either a Milly whom he never met or a Milly whom he once was but is no longer. In taking to his awfully quiet bed for three days, Lionel might, Christ-like, be read as preparing for a resurrection certainly (he is, after all, “only endless”.) Or it might be that his powers, thus blended into Milly’s, are being released precisely through his – perhaps voluntary, like Milly’s &amp;#8212; burial. Another way of reading this scenario is spatially. James’s text doesn’t specify a locale for Lionel’s bedroom in the house but it’s far from over-speculative to assume that by being in bed he is upstairs, that he is above Densher and Kate, just as they are above the recently buried Milly Theale. A few pages later, emphasizing the extent to which her dead friend is now above them, Kate is to famously claim that Milly’s wings “cover” both her and Densher.(8)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;8) James, &lt;i&gt;Wings&lt;/i&gt;, 406.&lt;/span&gt; Can we read the young lovers as, like Lionel and Milly, like Snediker’s and Sedgwick’s queer little gods, “covered” like the corpses of the dead, buried like the Catholic St. Antony and only efficacious because this has taken place? And can we read this anxious discussion as a first rather Poe-like recognition on their part that they have been buried? Perhaps Densher’s question is incomplete. Perhaps he needs to ask not what Lionel has done but, rather, “What has he done &lt;i&gt;to us&lt;/i&gt;?” A James outlined in that Gothic recognition of live burial is one to which Sedgwick would have been so responsive. The James outlined in that recognition would amount to powerful continuity between ‘Is the Rectum Straight’? and the essay to which it pays tribute, Bersani’s ‘Is the Rectum a Grave?’ The conceptual, literary, bodily and phantasmatic use of the preposition ‘&lt;i&gt;in’&lt;/i&gt; I’ve been outlining here echoes that very fine and quiet place, as Andrew Marvell would put it. But it also makes of that fine quietude something awful, as Kate puts it, producing awe, not only by virtue of its power to contain but also by virtue of its power, like Sedgwick’s and James’s cherished anus, to appropriate the world and to ensure thereby that uncanny powers are newly released. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay: The War on Effeminate Boys&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Mills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-RM.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s ‘How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay’ seems no less vital today than when it was first published in 1991.(1) &lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, ‘How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay,’ &lt;i&gt;Social Text &lt;/i&gt;29 (1991), 18–27; reprinted in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 154-164. Sedgwick first delivered the essay at a Modern Language Association panel in 1989.&lt;/span&gt; In December 2012, the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail &lt;/i&gt;– which has previously printed several defamatory pieces expressing concern about engaging schoolchildren “as young as &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt;” in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; History Month-related activities – published an article expressing only thinly disguised horror at the contents of a report recently commissioned by the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;, which includes, among its recommendations, advice that the corporation “put more gay presenters on children’s TV to “familiarise” youngsters with different sexualities”.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail &lt;/i&gt;(December 14 2012). See also Kate Loveys, ‘Gay Messages Built into School Maths Lessons for Children as young as &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FOUR&lt;/span&gt;,’ &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail &lt;/i&gt;(January 23 2011).&lt;/span&gt; And just last week, during the parliamentary debate on gay marriage, the Minister for Women and Equalities, Maria Miller, sought to reassure politicians that, under the new legislation, teachers will not be expected to ‘promote’ a version of marriage to schoolchildren that’s contrary to their beliefs (a word choice inadvertently replicating the language of Section 28). Sedgwick’s essay takes psychoanalysts and psychiatrists to task for their queer-eradicating impulses rather than journalists and politicians; but her claims concerning the absence of gay-affirmative discourses, especially those designed actively to nurture the lives of gay and proto-gay kids, continue to resonate powerfully in such contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galvanized by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;-fuelled fantasies of a world after the homosexual, the possibility of disappearance was a major driving force for queer politics at the time when ‘How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay’ was written. In a political climate where today &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; has been eclipsed by the high visibility of the same-sex marriage issue,and where a campaigner such as Peter Tatchell can declare – as he did last week – that “once we get same sex marriage, the goal [of lesbian and gay equality] will have been achieved”, it may seem like the ground has radically shifted in the intervening decades.(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Alison Roberts, ‘Boris Won Gay Marriage For Us – But I’m No Big Fan of it Myself’, &lt;i&gt;Evening Standard &lt;/i&gt;(8 February 2013).&lt;/span&gt; Or, to evoke the rhetoric of a recent, much-publicised response to queer teen suicides (the rates of which were, of course, Sedgwick’s starting point in her essay), perhaps things really are ‘getting better’ – at least, for kids able to aspire to the kinds of all-American success story that the founders of the It Gets Better Project suggest will be within reach of all queer youth if they simply hang on in there.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) www.itgetsbetter.org (accessed 12 February 2012). For a critique of the normalizing rhetoric of ‘it gets better,’ see Jasbir Puar, ‘In the wake of It Gets Better,’ &lt;i&gt;Guardian: Comment is Free &lt;/i&gt;(November 16 2010), http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/ cifamerica/2010/nov/16/wake-it-getsbetter-campaign (accessed February 12 2013); and, from the perspective of neoliberalism and the politics of bodily debility, Jasbir Puar, ‘Coda: The Cost of Getting Better: Suicide, Sensation, Switchpoints’, &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GLQ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;18.1 (2012), 149–58.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, now, is the state of play within the mental health professions concerning support for those same young people? The current, fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, published in 1994 and again, in slightly revised form, in 2000 (‘DSM-IV-TR’), continues to include a section identifying Gender Identity Disorder as a distinct diagnosis and to assign (for insurance purposes) separate diagnostic codes to childhood and adolescent/adult versions of it.(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) American Psychiatric Association, &lt;i&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental &lt;/i&gt;Disorders, 4th ed., text revision (Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000), 576–582.&lt;/span&gt; Sedgwick points out how in its earlier incarnation, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GID&lt;/span&gt; diagnosis is highly differential between boys and girls, since within this framework girls are assigned the pathologizing label only when they actually assert their anatomical maleness, whereas for boys the range of behaviours associated with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GID&lt;/span&gt; can include simply being preoccupied with “female stereotypical activities”.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 156.&lt;/span&gt; As you’ll see from the extracts I’ve provided, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;-IV-TR also now identifies as sufferers of the disorder girls who “prefer boy’s clothing and short hair”, adopt as fantasy heroes “powerful male figures, such as Batman or Superman”, “prefer boys as playmates, with whom they share interests in contact sports […] and traditional boyhood games”, and “show little interest in dolls or any form of feminine dress up or role-play activity”; but still, I was shocked to discover activities I myself enjoyed in childhood – playing house, expressing a liking for dolls, avoiding “rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports” – being listed here as the basis for a pathological diagnosis among boys. While &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt; is designed to function as a diagnostic tool rather than as a guide to treatment, it’s worth remembering that Dr Kenneth Zucker, who headed the team that devised these criteria, controversially favours reparative therapy as a means of ‘curing’ kids whose parents come to him seeking advice on how to raise their gender nonconforming progeny. Again, in 2008, Zucker was appointed to chair the working party on ‘Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders’ for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;-5, slated for publication in May 2013, despite protests from a number of high profile &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; activist groups; and while in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;-5 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GID&lt;/span&gt; will henceforth be relabelled ‘Gender Dysphoria’ it’s likely that comparable diagnostic criteria will be deployed.(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) Kelley Winters, ‘Gender Dysphoria Diagnosis to be Moved Out of Sexual Disorders Chapter of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;-5,’ &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GID&lt;/span&gt; Reform Weblog, http://gidreform.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/gender-dysphoria-diagnosis-to-bemoved-out-of-sexual-disorders-chapter-of-dsm-5/ (accessed February 12 2013).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in response to such therapeutic strategies, the institutional practices they foster and the books they spawn that Sedgwick makes perhaps her most incisive point regarding the motives for enforcing binary gender during childhood. What these books are ultimately about, she notes, is a “train of squalid lies. The overarching lie is the lie that they are predicated on anything but the therapists’ disavowed desire for a nongay outcome”.(8)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;8) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 161.&lt;/span&gt; Fighting a war against homosexuality on a front where it can be hidden from view (that’s to say, the battleground of gender variance, especially as it occurs in childhood), organisations like the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APA&lt;/span&gt; thus participate in what Sedgwick describes as a “silkily camouflaged complicity in oppression”.(9)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;9) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;164.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the personalities within the health professions may have changed, these sleights of hand continue to be performed in the name of psychiatric ‘care’: look at how, in his 2003 book &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Would Be Queen&lt;/i&gt;, the psychologist J. Michael Bailey claims certainly to have “no motive to change gay people or prevent them from being born” while, sentences later, justifying why parents might “select against” gay or gender-nonconforming kids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;The desire to spare their children the difficulties of societal intolerance of homosexuality, the desire to maximize their chances of having grandchildren, or the desire to have children like themselves in an important area of life: heterosexual marriage and reproduction. No one thinks that a Christian parents’ desire to raise their child as a Christian is evidence of their hatred of Jews or anyone else.(10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;10) J. Michael Bailey, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism &lt;/i&gt;(Washington D.C.: Joseph Henry, 2003), 113–114.&lt;/span&gt;Arguments such as this, which bizarrely compare phenomena Bailey identifies elsewhere as biological and ‘essential’ with religiously motivated acts of parenting, are dangerous not only because they deploy a barely concealed eugenicist framework: (pages later Bailey describes homosexuality as “evolutionarily maladaptive”). They are also part of the same culture of deception that seeks, in the work of Bailey’s associate Dr Zucker, to whom Bailey devotes several admiring pages, to promote such treatments as the removal of “feminine toys and accoutrements” from boys in order to reach the desired clinical goal of preventing them from becoming “transsexual” in adulthood.(11) &lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;11) Zucker’s treatment methods are discussed, approvingly, in Bailey, 28–31. For critical analysis, which begins with Sedgwick’s essay, see also Gustavus Stadler, ‘Queer and Disorderly,’ &lt;i&gt;Social Text 100&lt;/i&gt;, 27.3 (2009), 210–213.&lt;/span&gt;If, in the latest versions of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DSM&lt;/span&gt;, masculine girls now find themselves consigned along with effeminate boys to the haunting abject that Sedgwick so powerfully exposes, and if the aim of health professionals today, in steering kids towards identification with ‘traditional’ gender roles, is to avoid Zucker’s feared “transsexual outcome”, we should recognise that behind these trans-eradicating impulses – which themselves surely merit resistance at every turn – is a continued investment in the fantasy that mental health is synonymous with gender normativity and that teaching children the value of conforming to this fantasy is motivated by, among other things, a desire to ‘spare’ them from societal discomfort. Is it getting better, I ask? Sedgwick’s essay provocatively draws attention to the ways in which certain narratives of progress may simply be a veneer, behind which the project of normalization can be preserved unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Epidemics of the Will&lt;br /&gt;
Alexander Beaumont&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-AB.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I make any comments on ‘Epidemics of the Will’, I should explain that my approach to Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s essay grows out of my work on the valences of freedom as a political concept in the wake of experiments with the term by schools of theory and praxis influenced by the development of poststructuralism &amp;#8211; particularly British cultural studies &amp;#8211; during the 1980s and 1990s. In the course of my research, I have found in this intellectual tradition a highly productive critique of the ways in which freedom has been exploited in the contemporary conjuncture as a means of producing disciplinary subjects who accord with the particular requirements of a neoliberal model of political economy. At the same time, this critique has, it seems to me, been limited by its tendency to assume that political possibility is thus to be located in the capacity of unfreedom to expose and undermine the way in which freedom has been rendered amenable to new, totalised mechanisms of governmentality that are only the more insidious for being predicated on voluntarism. This tendency is quite apparent in ‘Epidemics of the Will’, and later on I will be setting out in terms that are necessarily polemical, given the brief amount of time I have, my misgivings about its potential as a form of praxis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I do this, however, I want to ask two fairly simple questions. First, do Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s comments on the growth of addiction discourse during the historical moment in which she was writing account for the complexity of the discourse as it has developed over the last twenty years? Second, did they even account for how this discourse was developing outside the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; at the time she was writing? The 12-point plan has always seemed to me a peculiarly American phenomenon; indeed, as Pat O&amp;#8217;Malley had suggested, where narcotics are concerned there has been a growing tendency &amp;#8211; especially outside the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; to speak of drug &lt;i&gt;use &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;misuse&lt;/i&gt;, rather than addiction.(1)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;1) Pat, O&amp;#8217;Malley, ‘Drugs, Risks and Freedoms: Illicit Drug &amp;#8216;Use&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Misuse&amp;#8217; Under Neo-Liberal Governance’, &lt;i&gt;Sydney Law School Research Paper No. 09/120&lt;/i&gt;, 7. Social Science Research Network Electronic Library. n.d. Web. 27 Feb. 2013.&lt;/span&gt; Of course, Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s comments in ‘Epidemics of the Will’ are not limited to the particular form addiction discourse took in relation to narcotics. Nonetheless, her decision to reproduce, in however ironic a fashion, the kind of semi-religious idiom that was synthesised with the language of psychiatry when the twelve-point plan was developed during the 1930s &amp;#8211; an idiom reflected in the critical significance she attributes to the “healthy free will” characterised by “consolation, repose, beauty, [and] energy”(2)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;132.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; demonstrates the influence of the neoconservative ideology underpinning the ‘War on Drugs’ on the development of addiction discourse in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; during the late twentieth century. Significantly, however, the explicitly moral tenor of this ideology didn&amp;#8217;t take hold in other Anglophone countries in quite the same way. Instead, a ‘de-moralised’ discourse owing more to neoliberalism has developed, taking the form of a tolerance which exploits the disciplinary potential of a carefully bounded freedom in order to keep individual behaviour in check. Crucially, the pathological language surrounding this discourse isn&amp;#8217;t one of addiction, in which behaviour engaged in freely has led paradoxically to an inability to exercise free will; rather, it reflects a more thoroughgoing instrumentalisation of rational choice theory in which the ‘abuse’ of a given substance becomes equivalent to the ‘abuse’ of the faculty of choice itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&amp;#8217;Malley accords a significant degree of importance to this distinction, and is clearer than Sedgwick in aligning the question of drugs policy with the concept of freedom, as well as the latter&amp;#8217;s uses to an emerging neoliberal disciplinary regime. Opposing American to British and especially Australasian approaches to drugs discourse, he argues that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='blocktext'&gt;two forms of liberal freedom can be contrasted, each associated with different technologies of government and techniques of the self: a neo-conservative, classical liberal freedom of independence, sobriety and moral responsibility; and a more morally relative neo-liberal freedom of choice, involving enhanced autonomy, activity and self fulfilment. While they share much in common, notably a faith in markets and competition, and a dislike of state based ‘interventionism’ associated with the welfare state, the differences and tensions encompassed in the New Right alliance was fertile soil for divergence.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;3) O’Malley, ‘Drugs’, 6.&lt;/span&gt; In a sense, Sedgwick might be described as writing during an historical moment when an addiction discourse predicated on a &lt;i&gt;neoconservative &lt;/i&gt;understanding of freedom was being gradually replaced in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; by a use/misuse discourse predicated on a &lt;i&gt;neoliberal &lt;/i&gt;understanding of the term. Indeed, what seems to be happening at the moment, as states such as Colorado vote in favour of what is sometimes called an &amp;#8220;evidence-based&amp;#8221; approach to drugs legislation, is a process not so much of liberalisation but &lt;i&gt;neo&lt;/i&gt;liberalisation, in which the moral content of addiction discourse is finally displaced by what is billed as a progressive, libertarian approach in which, as O&amp;#8217;Malley puts it, &amp;quot;the risks” of drug use “appear as probabilistic events triggered by the failure of the user to take necessary avoiding steps”(4)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;4) O’Malley, ‘Drugs’, 14.&lt;/span&gt; Sedgwick writes that &amp;quot;so long as &amp;#8216;free will&amp;#8217; has been hypostatized and charged with ethical value, for just so long has an equally hypostatized &amp;#8216;compulsion&amp;#8217; had to be available as a counterstructure always internal to it, always requiring to be ejected from it”. But she also writes &amp;#8211; correctly &amp;#8211; that “the compulsion behind everyday voluntarity is driven, ever more blindly, by its own compulsion to isolate some new, receding but absolutized space of pure voluntarity”.(5)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 133-134.&lt;/span&gt; This space of “pure voluntarity” is, I would suggest, equivalent to the space of “pure freedom” celebrated by libertarian thinkers such as Isaiah Berlin, and &amp;#8211; for good or ill &amp;#8211; it is taking on a putatively progressive form in the kind of pop-libertarianism currently in vogue in the United States. The key point, however, is that, despite its purported progressivism, the free will around which this agenda is organised is absolutely not charged with ethical value; nor, I might add, is it charged with political value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, we see that the relationship between governance and freedom continues to be at the heart of what Sedgwick identified with her term “epidemics of the will”; however, today, instead of witnessing the kind of morally-inflected &lt;i&gt;maladie de la volonté &lt;/i&gt;bequeathed American neoconservatism by nineteenth-century addiction discourse, we see a more advanced, more thoroughly rationalised and rationalising logic taking hold, in which freedom becomes both the ideological lodestone of contemporary political discourse and also the means by which the subject is governmentalised most clearly. As Mariana Valverde, writing specifically about alcoholism, puts it: “[G]overnance of [&amp;#8230;] addiction [is] not characterized by the government of substances as much as by the attempt to use substances (and, more recently, addictive behaviours) to govern the realm of freedom”.(6)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;6) Mariana Valverde,&lt;i&gt; Diseases of the Will: Alcohol and the Dilemmas of Freedom&lt;/i&gt; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 28.&lt;/span&gt; What&amp;#8217;s more, she adds, this attempt to govern the realm of freedom so often takes the form of a knowing conspiracy on the part of contemporary society to maintain the ideological status quo: “We know”, she writes, that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='blocktext'&gt;deep down [&amp;#8230;] freedom is just another word used by the authorities to govern us, to sell us things, to persuade us to accept coercion of all kinds; but we nevertheless find it impossible to do without the belief in freedom [&amp;#8230;]. It is [&amp;#8230;] the potential for the ironical displacement not of this or that theory of addiction but of the very idea of a quest for personal freedom that distinguishes today&amp;#8217;s epidemics of the will from those of earlier times.(7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;7) Valverde, &lt;i&gt;Diseases, &lt;/i&gt;21.&lt;/span&gt;This points to a crucial way in which Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s analysis forms a kind of vanguard to political conversations that have become important areas of critical activity twenty years later: specifically, the engagement with Foucault&amp;#8217;s late lectures on governmentality and how these have been interpolated into discussions about the relationship between neoliberalism and postmodernity. However, it seems to me important that this discussion has led to an emerging sense that a subject position of radical alterity, nested at the heart of an hegemonic discourse, no longer leads inevitably to provocative critique but often to disenfranchisement and even death. Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s comments on addiction anticipate the focus on biopolitics which, though initiated by Foucault well before the publication of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies &lt;/i&gt;in 1993, has since become a key characteristic of critical inquiry. And one of its major interventions has been to wonder whether the kind of oppositionality described by Sedgwick and taken up by poststructuralist critics more widely &amp;#8211; the kind, that is, predicated on discursive irruptions and lacunae rather than collective belonging and political mobilisation &amp;#8211; is actually capable of doing the work of politics in the twenty first century. Indeed, one complaint that a post-Marxist critic might make of poststructuralism and its intellectual inheritance generally is that, for all its focus on the politics of class, race, sex, gender, sexuality, textuality and so on, its critique is actually predicated on an insufficiently theorised concept of the political itself. This isn&amp;#8217;t, I hasten to add, to say that the critical potential of such strategies has been blunted; however, it might suggest a more circumscribed role for “poststructuralist politics” &lt;i&gt;qua &lt;/i&gt;the political in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this situation has arisen as a consequence of the reluctance of critics in these areas to work &lt;i&gt;with &lt;/i&gt;the ideas of freedom and authority, which together constitute the field of the political in the work of writers such as Hannah Arendt. It has long been a critical strategy of poststructuralist theory to cast light on subject positions that are structured by these concepts but which have little or no stake in the space they demarcate &amp;#8211; the space, that is, of politics &amp;#8211; and I think that the consequence of such a strategy has been a tendency to locate a species of freedom precisely in the concept of unfreedom. Such a tendency is evidenced quite clearly in ‘Epidemics of the Will’ when Sedgwick speculates that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='blocktext'&gt;smokers could unite to claim rights, not as embodiments of that ultimate freedom, the freedom to smoke, but rather as addicts, as people who define themselves as not having freedom with respect to smoking[&amp;#8230;]. It is only by making something like this claim to, or acknowledgement of, the pathologised addict identity that smokers, as a body, could, paradoxically, empower themselves in legal, economic, and ideological contestation against the tobacco companies.(8) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;8) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 141.&lt;/span&gt;Now, this may very well have been true for smokers at the time &lt;i&gt;Tendencies &lt;/i&gt;was published; after all, there was (and remains) a financial imperative for such a subject position to exist. But what happens when there is no such imperative? When a subject becomes, from a biopolitical point of view, expendable? Well the result then isn&amp;#8217;t, to echo Foucault, that the subject is made to live, but that she is allowed to die. For why should a subject who holds no place in the space of politics, who is structured by the political field but not recognised as belonging to it, be granted, in Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s words, “affordable or free, high-quality, nonjudgmental health care”?(9)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;9) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 141.&lt;/span&gt; The addict is certainly a subject position; but she&amp;#8217;s also, crucially, a civic person. In the process of rationalising the subject, however, neoliberalism has led very often to the peeling back of markers of civic belonging, and this process has unsurprisingly mapped quite neatly onto existing hierarchies of power determined by class, race, gender and sexuality. The risk with the hypothetical strategy Sedgwick outlines at the end of ‘Epidemics of the Will’ is that it assumes &amp;#8211; complacently, perhaps &amp;#8211; that such markers of civic belonging exist as a matter of course. But in the neoliberal order, once the subject has no utility, she is perfectly expendable. She may locate a kind of political possibility in the unfreedom of her pathology, but if this can be described as a species of freedom at all, it&amp;#8217;s the freedom of Agamben&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;homo sacer&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#8211; which is to say, no freedom at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick is right to encourage us to attend to the paradoxes of freedom in the present conjuncture, and in this respect ‘Epidemics of the Will’ continues to be an important intervention, if for no other reason than that it confronts us with the fact that freedom has become a fundamental tool in the care of the self. But as Nikolas Rose suggests, freedom has also become the basis for all modern and contemporary models of governmentality, to such a degree that “values and presuppositions given the name of freedom and liberty have come to provide the ground upon which governmentality must enact its practices”.(10)&lt;span class='marginalnote'&gt;10) Nikolas Rose, &lt;i&gt;Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought&lt;/i&gt; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 11.&lt;/span&gt; Nikolas is a good deal more optimistic than Sedgwick about the opportunities this affords contemporary society &amp;#8211; though it also has to be said that he looks at governmentality rather more from the point of view of the governing logic than the governed subject. Nonetheless, this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that his point about the significance of freedom as a concept need necessarily be cast aside, and I think it is worth asking of Sedgwick, of queer theory and of poststructuralism generally what might be made of freedom, not simply as a critical tool, but as a concept that could also, if appropriated and reconfigured by a political discourse which was prepared to acknowledge its radical uses, provide the basis for a new politics predicated on inclusion, pluralism and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-II.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, I’m Izzy Isgate, I’m a PhD researcher in the Department of English and Related Literature at York (where I’m writing an ethics of Materiality), and I’m going to be thinking today with Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s ‘Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl’. I’m opening with song lyrics from Shawn Colvin’s ‘Diamond in the Rough’: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;As a little girl I came down to the water&lt;br&gt;
With a little stone in my hand&lt;br&gt;
It would shimmer and sing&lt;br&gt;
And we knew everything&lt;br&gt;
As a little girl I came down&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But in a little while I got steeped in authority&lt;br&gt;
Heaven only knows what went wrong&lt;br&gt;
There is nothing so cruel than&lt;br&gt;
To bury that jewel&lt;br&gt;
When it was mine all along&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m gonna find it.(1) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt; 1) Shawn Colvin, ‘Diamond in the Rough’, &lt;i&gt;Steady On &lt;/i&gt;(Columbia, 1989).&lt;/span&gt;When Professor Jason Edwards asked&lt;i&gt; me &lt;/i&gt;to position a paper on the ‘Masturbating Girl’ – on &lt;i&gt;Valentine’s day&lt;/i&gt; (!) – any indignation that may have reduced me to my infantilised, and shaming, Catholically schooled guilt soon held out a promise of pedagogical pleasure. Poised on the edge of my seat, [as I’d like to think you all are now] as I stroked and gently tapped the keys whilst writing, thinking about how I might tease this paper out, tantalise it from its hidden place, I put my finger on the delight of what it might mean to stand in this academic space and publicly, somewhat onerously, own onanism. And so, if you receive this paper as purely pleasurable exhibitionism (someway enticed by Sedgwick’s provocation) then that is what the masturbating girl (and taking up her position) is want to do; she is as risky (or risqué) as she is reparative, opening and teasing herself to be disciplined. The masturbating girl is purposefully performative, and I suggest perfuse in her political potentially, not least because I delightfully position her, as a gesture to circle, circumnavigate, and so &lt;i&gt;de-center&lt;/i&gt; the normative/normativising stance of critical theory, which has been so anxiously fixated with playing with its own phallus (from Freud to Lacan, even through Derrida and Butler) – and I take pleasure in defiantly reveling in pleasure’s disavowal from theoretical discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I might call this paper ‘Intellectual Wanking: (I Know What You Did Last Term)’; the affective strategy of which would not only play upon the possibility of what Sedgwick calls ‘Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading (Or, You’re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay is About You)’ – and I hope in some way that you &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;know that my paper is – but also to finger the disciplining, accusatory, occasionally wagging and pointed, finger from which we are increasingly under pressure in Arts and Humanities as a discipline, as research productivity and value is increasingly understood in terms of public engagement and impact. As Arts and Humanities loses funding hand over fist (and I’ll discuss the ethics of fisting another time), and sciences are prioritised, to attach value in terms of ‘productivity’/’re-productivity’ arguably becomes an anti queer move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I wondered how might I &lt;i&gt;publicly&lt;/i&gt; engage with masturbation? As a fledgling queer academic who is constantly being asked to make my research fit for “Fun, Family Friendly Activities’, I am only too happy to point out the ways in which families aren’t always necessarily fun, and to suggest that masturbation could be, and indeed should be, fun for all the family.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My refusal to participate structures me not only as the queer deviant, but also as the killer of familial (and re/productive) joy – the masturbating girl exposing herself at the family party. Insofar as she remains undisciplined, the masturbating girl defiantly spoils the fantasy of ‘productive value’, taking pleasure in pleasure, for her own pleasure’s sake. She therefore becomes ‘disciplined’ through the denial of her own body, incorporated into a teleological narrative through which her learning pleasures are re-inscribed as a stepping stone, en route, to a productive and re-productive future. Indeed, as we bring the privacy of intellectual work out in the public sphere, it threatens to expose the academic body that is arts and humanities as a pleasure seeking one. The recent critical turn towards trauma studies, holocaust studies, Arts and Human rights &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; disciplines, that are ever-so-pleased-with-themselves to legitimise the value of how arts and humanities research is done, I suggest is a turn away from and disavowal of pleasure – a critical oscillation that exposes its own masochism, which it then refuses to own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-II-cartoon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst Sedgwick describes the “highly relational but […] solitary pleasure and adventure of writing” as “mental masturbation”, as this panel from Alison Bechdel’s &lt;i&gt;Fun Home &lt;/i&gt;(2006) suggests, the performativity of knowledge also extends to the reading body. To position oneself as a researcher and a reader, immersed in the pleasures of texts – we might question whether ‘bookishness’, and the figure of the intellect, occupies a newly queer position – in terms of the psychosexual narratives of developmental stages, (like the queer subject) the ‘intellectual wanker’ is one who has not yet reached full sexual, productive, maturity. A scholar still looking to be schooled – a masturbating girl in need of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am constantly being &lt;i&gt;queried&lt;/i&gt; by non-academics friends (some of them scientific researchers), those in the ‘Human Fray’: “But, Izzy what do you do all day?” Often followed by: “also, working from home how do you get any work done?” The implication I take to mean, what with Internet pornography and a lot of, well, time on your hands &amp;#8211; how productive could you possibly be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I respond: I do take pleasure in my solitary research, being able to work from home so that I can read, write, and take occasional pause to stroke my pussy/cat. Positioned as the masturbating girl, the fruits of my pleasure’s labour are deemed to be unproductive; conveying an ideology that both overlooks what cultivating an ethics of self-relation might do, and any inter-relational transformative affect through my teaching encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In these times of ‘austerity’- never so much have we wanted our Austen to be Austere (rather than, say, queerly ostentatious)? Austen’s masturbating girl, (who Sedgwick reveals as the girl being taught a lesson) still has something to teach us twenty years on. She comes again not only to throw into question the dialectics of pleasure and pain and what they reveal about our pedagogical practices, but to also ask: What is the value and impact of masturbation? Who will fund it? Is there room for pleasure in the academy? Publicly she incites the same “phobic narratives” as she did in the hands of Sedgwick, as accusations of pedagogical ‘corruption’, re-emerge in the recent press outrage at the Educational Secretary’s defense of “student’s right to study French Lesbian Poetry”, (one might think this discloses a panic about the French psychoanalytic feminist tradition, as much as it is homophobic, if only the press were that clever). Although she may be offered a moment of pleasurable pedagogy within which to find herself, heaven forbid the masturbating girl comes out of her closeted intellectualism, only to be find herself a lesbian! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude. For the masturbating girl, pleasure and its (disciplining) disavowal often come hand in hand, as a plethora of female masturbatory terms from ‘kitty whipping’ to ‘fingering the accused’ reveal. And so, to take in hand ‘Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl’ is not only to hold and caress, but also to discipline, revealing within it a pedagogical sadism through which epistemological thought becomes knowable. Within my own discipline, such strokes of pedagogical pleasure and pain are made implicit through the pleasures of the terms of ‘literary &lt;i&gt;criticism&lt;/i&gt;’ (as much as the disciplining affects of ‘&lt;i&gt;critical&lt;/i&gt; theory’ are rendered explicit under their own terms). Take for (one last frivolous) example: ‘Fanny Bashing’. You can imagine, reader, my anti climax to be coming across, the Jane Austen Society website, on “the most controversial topic on Austen” with a discretionary “warning [to]… read at my own risk”, only to find that the provocatively entitled ‘Fanny Bashing’ was a critical discussion on the idiosyncratic merit (or lack thereof) of &lt;i&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/i&gt;’s Fanny Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ‘masturbate’ is a term, that takes pleasure in its ‘mastery’ – the affective means through which we become pleasurably proficient and disciplined. As intellectuals who find thinking and writing both pleasurable and painful, as we are constantly reaching – clamouring to put our finger on that (seemingly elusive) climactic apotheosis [as I am now] – pedagogical masturbation becomes our own autoerotic s/m: the practice and means through which we &lt;i&gt;crack&lt;/i&gt; our own whip. [We all know well the self-discipline yet expansive pleasures through which Doctoral research, books, and indeed &lt;i&gt;conference papers&lt;/i&gt;, are produced]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, as an oscillatory gesture of pleasurable repetition – I will close as I opened, thereby leaving you with an opening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;As a little girl I came down to the water&lt;br&gt;
With a little stone in my hand&lt;br&gt;
It would shimmer and sing&lt;br&gt;
And we knew everything&lt;br&gt;
As a little girl I came down&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But in a little while I got steeped in authority&lt;br&gt;
Heaven only knows what went wrong&lt;br&gt;
There is nothing so cruel than&lt;br&gt;
to bury that jewel&lt;br&gt;
When it was mine all along&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m gonna find it&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;‘Memorial for Craig Owens’ and ‘White Glasses’&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah Monks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-SM.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things more difficult for myself (and why not?), I’m going to triangulate these two texts and their central motif – friendship – with the process and production of drawing, something that I’ve been thinking about recently in abstract, as an art historian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These final chapters of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; show Sedgwick attempting to describe the queer state that is friendship. Unrecognised in law and undetailed in language (although significantly ‘friend’ itself stems from the Germanic terms for ‘love’, ‘caress’ and ‘woo’), friendship is perhaps the most under-determined and under-represented relation we have with others. Devoid of pre-existing frameworks, conventions and expressions, ‘friendship’ is freshly drawn and revised with each new relation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendship is therefore a creative act. Hence perhaps Sedgwick’s ironic appropriation of the syntax of heterosexual reproduction in ‘Memorial for Craig Owens’, a discussion of friendship’s effects in which the “enigmatic” and “magnetic” aura he held for her, the sheer &lt;i&gt;draw&lt;/i&gt; of him, is described with a fitting cupidity. Their relationship therefore appears as a form of “cherished adhesion” in which Owens becomes both the source and the figure of a productive projectile, in an explicit statement of friendship’s procreative dimensions, its capacity for the generation of ideas, texts and tertiary outcomes &amp;#8211; however intermittent and distended that relationship might have been “in real life” (whatever that is). As such, friendship is described here as a process – that is to say, as a state without finite end(s), or properties, a state of momentum and potentially ongoing fabrication – which is always triangulated through forms of representation and interpretation (a term whose etymological connotations of ‘spreading or talking between’ suggest how proximate acts of interpretation and social affiliation might be). The challenge that Sedgwick takes on in these two chapters is to transform this unsignified yet seminal process into a motif capable of being articulated – to turn the ground against which thoughts figure, into a meaningful figure in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Knowledge’ of the friend (of their tastes, their biographies, their secrets) can play no substantial part in this descriptive process since, thanks to its impossible demands for completeness and conclusion, such knowledge will always get in the way of attempts to capture friendship’s processual and inter-pretive state, its smudginess. Indeed, the ability to bear comprehensive or delineating witness to the friend’s ‘real life’ manifestation (through statements which are, anyway, so often grounded in competition over contact hours) can only be a product of the consciousness of differentiation and &lt;i&gt;separation&lt;/i&gt; from the friend, of the line &lt;i&gt;between&lt;/i&gt; us and them. Furthermore, such consciousness results even from attempts at direct approximation: in attempting to (become) like our friends by taking on their props, poses and perspectives – as Sedgwick did with Michael Lynch’s idiosyncratic white-framed spectacles – we are forced to realise not only our differences from them (and from ourselves) but also the opacity of their experiences to our understanding even when those experiences are, like the wearing of white glasses, shared. Other forms of enquiry and knowledge are therefore required to do justice to friendship, forms which Sedgwick ardently called for in these two chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to suggest that one answer might be found in the very structures and veils which divide us from each other – and which therefore form a shared connective field whose opacity makes it radically available to acts of equivalence, identification and communication unregulated by temporal, legal or linguistic norms. In other words, I want to promote the &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; value of fantasy as a mutual state within intersubjectivity, over and against the reality principle to which fantasy is conventionally compared as a pathological or aberrant inversion, invoked in order to be corrected through ‘knowledge’. In the apparent yet misleading blankness of their frames, the white glasses might (as Sedgwick suggests) therefore be a figure for the tertiary space of representation and interpretation – the space of fantasy, imagination and free yet sparking ‘play’ – in which friendship is experienced. This opaque yet richly-stuffed space exists at some distance from the binaries, taxonomies and categorical distinctions at stake ‘in real life’, and it’s therefore a space across which we connect with each other differently yet substantially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, it will probably be clear that I think meaningful parallels can be drawn between this opaque field – which serves as the actual common ground of friendship and which is constantly inscribed with tertiary figures of thought and feeling – and the sheet of paper which supports a drawing. This is not however to wish for the humanist reification of interpersonal communication and connection as being as unproblematic and as unspecified as a blank sheet of paper; Sedgwick’s work rightly urges us to consider ways of connecting &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the necessary demise of such universalising concepts. Instead, I want to correlate friendship and drawing as processes which take place on opaque grounds and (therefore) within what Sedgwick calls a ‘discontinuous projective space of desire’ where the shapes and textures of things (of bodies, voices, tonalities and material signs) are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example here might be this portrait of Richard Westall (Figure 1),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='pptcenter' src='/images/preview/T20-SM-Fig1-InText.jpg'&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in which drawing and kissing seem to coincide. Here, forms and surfaces alternately confront, and turn away from, the viewer in a reciprocal dynamic which also characterised the drawing’s production by these two artists – Thomas Lawrence and Westall himself. Whose idea was this drawing? Who began it, and who joined in? Is this a portrait, or a self-portrait, or something in-between, a work in which two men and three positions (artist, sitter and artist-sitter) overlay each other upon a single sheet of paper?  Such contact is given notational form in the smudging with which much of Westall’s face, hair and body has been rendered, in acts of rubbing and &lt;i&gt;drawing&lt;/i&gt; through which the medium is pulled (and at times, seemingly kissed) across the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might find the textual equivalent for such rubbing in the repetitions and rhythms of Sedgwick’s prose in ‘White Glasses’. “The first time I met Michael Lynch… When I first met Michael Lynch… The day I first met Michael Lynch…” – Sedgwick’s invocation of her dead friend is a mantra, a rocking back and forth and longed-for return, always with variations. Here, at the level of prose formation, is a recognition that creation is always recreation. But it’s also an example of how lines are strengthened when retraced &lt;i&gt;differently&lt;/i&gt;, whether with greater confidence or with increased doubt, whether hesitantly this time or other ends sought the next. If such a centripetal pattern of expression and meaning is the pattern of friendship, it’s also the pattern of ‘drawing’ in the dictionary sense of ‘imparting motion or impulse in the direction of an actuating force’. Both friendship and drawing might therefore be understood as processes of attraction, pulling and propulsion, and of loading, variation and renewal, processes of which they are also as well the products. In both, lines of thought, feeling, connection and differentiation are hazarded, assayed and returned to upon open supports, in processes which are historically contingent and yet rarely determined in full by external forces. Indeed, if they can be characterised at all (which is debatable in both cases), friendship and drawing might be characterised by their shared state of permanent invention and incompletion, by their lack of the ‘frame’ which would resolve them into products more than processes, into settled ‘legitimate’ relationships on the one hand and into ‘works of art’ on the other. Both friendship and drawing might be defined, then, by their &lt;i&gt;lack&lt;/i&gt; of definition – and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;********************&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so to endings, in this, the final presentation of the conference, in which I have responded to two texts about death and life. I want to conclude with a waggish and somewhat disjointed coda, a tail (Italian: ‘cauda’), both an ending – a passage of ‘more or less independent character introduced after the completion of the essential parts… so as to form a more definite and satisfactory conclusion’ – and a ‘start’ (the eighteenth-century term for a tail or handle).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading them again, the last two chapters of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; brought to mind Justus Lipsius’s &lt;i&gt;An Epigram on Mopsus&lt;/i&gt; (1605), a rhetorical essay on friendship to which Sedgwick’s words seem a distant heir. Here, the early modern university lecturer offers his students a Taciturn model of friendship whose exemplary form is that offered by his own dog, Mopsus. That Lipsius’s canine philosophy was both characteristic and longheld is suggested by Goltzius’s portrait of him, produced almost twenty years earlier, in which a clear equivalence is forged between dogs and books as sources of profound and meaningful knowledge (Figure 2),&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img class='pptcenter' src='/images/preview/T20-SM-Fig2-InText.jpg'&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as academies of equal value. Indeed, the intensity with which Lipsius appears to clutch the dog’s head and that head’s location within the portrait, there where academic sitters conventionally gestured towards human skulls, suggest that the lessons about friendship offered by Mopsus and his kind (and converted into words by Lipsius) are also hugely significant lessons about life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I am reminded in turn of just how often dogs and other pets have served as infant academies for artists – as, for famous example, in Edwin Landseer’s prize-winning childhood drawing (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img class='pptcenter' src='/images/preview/T20-SM-Fig3-InText.jpg'&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as Landseer’s subsequent sketches of dogs suggest, with their concerted and equal attention to the back halves of his subjects, the tail is an extraordinarily expressive device, seemingly articulating a range of responses to the world which might include (we imagine) happiness, readiness, excitement, submission, irritation, fear, boredom…  The tail is a form of punctuation, an indicator of tense, a grammatical effect, a voice, all of these things. Yet it also seems to have a semi-independent status, part of yet different from the body to which it belongs, and which it is also capable of motivating and driving, when ‘the tail wags the dog’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this phrase in the academy to describe procedural errors of interpretation in which context (or ground) begins to dominate text (or figure), in which that which should &lt;i&gt;inform&lt;/i&gt; begins to be that which is &lt;i&gt;informed&lt;/i&gt; – in which the ‘proper’ roles (of academic enquiry) are reversed. Fittingly then, Sedgwick repeatedly reminds us of the virtues of letting the tail wag the dog, of holding the reins of interpretation in other ways that we have been taught. In this way, she reminds us, we can cast into relief the processes of control, refusal and regulation with which we are inducted, described and contained by the academy: as in drawing, we see things by leaving off from them. In letting the tail wag the dog sometimes, we might see and appreciate more clearly the moments at which interpretation is in play, and in which life – and with that, friendship – is constituted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Willa Cather and Others&lt;br /&gt;
Pam Thurschwell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-PT.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Willa Cather and Others’ should be remembered in Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick’s wonderful &lt;i&gt;oeuvre&lt;/i&gt; if only for the fact that, in it, she describes Prince’s  1987 song ‘If I Was Your Girlfriend’ as “astonishingly Proustian” (1)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 172.&lt;/span&gt;, which surely must be one of the most accurate, and most evocative two word descriptions of a work in all of pop music criticism, gender theory, or, although my knowledge of this area is shakier, Proust criticism. But, in this essay, she also (some might argue, more centrally) writes about Cather’s 1905 short story, ‘Paul’s Case’ in a way, which I think, is a prime example of the structure of care which pervades her style and her work. Her readings here exemplify why thinking through Sedgwick’s criticism makes you cognizant of intimacies and entanglements with characters, with texts, and with language, which illuminate books, genders and sexualities, and their difficult to decipher historical moments, with an affective lucidity which is hard to do justice to in a 5-10 minute paper. I’ll do my best by talking a little bit about her reading of, and care for, Paul and Cather, and gesturing towards the kind of readings, and affective structures, it might inspire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To travel with Sedgwick’s thinking on Willa Cather’s complicated relationship to her character Paul is to be caught up in a tangle of identifications and disidentifications, of affection and repulsion; in the essay Sedgwick unpicks the crossings which stratified and separated gay male from lesbian lives and cultures in the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century—she then reaches for a kind of reparation, both in terms of what she sees Cather doing in the past, and in her own generous reading of the story, in the now of 1989 (when the essay was written). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Sedgwick reminds us of Cather’s sometime history of being an “effeminophobic bully” who wrote a damning indictment of Oscar Wilde at the time of his trials.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;168.&lt;/span&gt; “Wilde ‘is in prison now’ Cather wrote in her newspaper columns in 1895, ‘most deservedly so. Upon his head is heaped the deepest infamy and the darkest shame of a generation. Civilization shudders at his name, and there is absolutely no spot on earth where this man can live.’”(3)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 169.&lt;/span&gt; And what, in Cather’s eyes was Wilde’s crime? Sedgwick wryly points out to us that it is not quite the one you might suspect: “‘Insincerity,’ Cather writes, ‘Art that is artificial and insincere [&amp;#8230;] for which there is no forgiveness in Heaven, no forgetting in Hell’”.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 169.&lt;/span&gt; As Sedgwick puts it, “The odd oversight of the framers of the Criminal Law Amendment Act and the 1885 Labouchère Amendment to it, in omitting to include by name the unspeakable crimes of artificiality and insincerity, doesn’t slow Cather a bit in this determined act of redefinition”.(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;169.&lt;/span&gt; According to Sedgwick, Cather repudiates Wilde’s effeminate art of the artificial in order to distinguish it, and him, from herself, and her own sincere, American, butch art, steeped in a prairie realism, resting firmly on a love of the natural. Yet, as Sedgwick also points out, even as Cather disavows Wilde, she creates a space for some kind of awkward, future recognition of a shared sexual identity, a sort of off-hand, partially redemptive gesture toward the desires and acts which, when compared to the unspeakable aesthete’s sin of artistic artifice, are really not so bad as all that. As Cather goes on to write: “‘The sins of the body are very small compared with that’”; with artificiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick continues, in a careful and attentive reading, to show Cather’s apparent change of heart toward Wilde through her rendering of the adolescent, criminal, would-be Wildean aesthete, Paul, in Cather’s own favourite of her short stories, ‘Paul’s Case’ from 1905. “If the early parts of ‘Paul’s Case’ seem written from […] unloving compulsions[,…] the latter part of the story, after Paul has stolen a thousand dollars from his father’s employer and run away to New York, opens out to what seems to me an amazing tenderness of affirmation”.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;170.&lt;/span&gt; And I love that phrase and want to return to it, to try and describe what it would be like to write criticism with an amazing tenderness of affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul’s story ends with an interestingly semi-scientific, detached take on his suicide, but along the way something rather astonishing happens, something I had not noticed in my own compulsive re-readings of the story, until Sedgwick pointed it out. What happens? Well, Paul gets what he wants: the grand, luxurious, artificial high life of the Waldorf Astoria, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;, it turns out that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; actually what he wanted after all. How often does that happen, Sedgwick asks? “How common is it […] for a powerfully desiring character to get the thing that he desires, and to learn immediately that he was right—that what he wanted really is the thing that would make him happy?”(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;170.&lt;/span&gt; Especially when that thing is not great art, or great love, but rather the joys of consumer goods? (Think of how this plot development might have changed our take-away from &lt;i&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/i&gt;). In Paul’s case, we see him surrounded by specially purchased flowers, and an elegant new wardrobe in a luxurious hotel room, all bought with stolen money&amp;#8212; he looks into the mirror and the story states, “Everything was quite perfect; he was exactly the kind of boy he always wanted to be”.(8)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;8) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 170.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, taking off from Sedgwick’s reading, this is amongst other things, a rather lovely ‘Screw you, Lacan’ moment. To give ‘the mirror stage’ it’s due, one could easily argue that this is a misrecognition, or at least a very fleeting satisfaction, and that in the unfolding of the story a punitive logic reasserts itself—Paul’s image here is a stolen and temporary one, and within a few pages he will throw himself in front of a train rather than returning to his desultory working-class life in Pittsburgh. However, Sedgwick’s reading points towards the wild unlikeliness of Cather’s and  the story’s ratification of the truth of Paul’s desire for artifice, &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;—the story’s odd detached and clinical, yet also strangely satisfying narrative investment in Paul’s fulfilled image of himself. The ostracized, effeminate, neurotic and neurosis-producing in those who view him, queer, bullied boy gets his own back by rejecting his background, instead finding the wherewithal to create himself anew, and his self-fashioning make sense. Here, in the Waldorf Astoria, the mirror doesn’t lie:  “’He felt now that his surroundings explained him’”.(9)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;9) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 170.&lt;/span&gt; You might say that, in terms Cather might use to defend him, Paul is &lt;i&gt;naturally&lt;/i&gt; artificial. Cather, here, does seem to take up Paul’s case on the affirmative side, and Sedgwick, follows her in making this affirmation stronger. The story, and Sedgwick’s subtle reading of it, creates a space where Paul’s arguably narcissistic, criminalized, eventually suicidal, adolescent love of a version of himself, becomes a kind of affirmation of a shared more capacious way of thinking about the self—one big enough to encompass Cather, Paul, Wilde. Paul does the reparative work for Cather’s earlier Wilde-o-phobia. Cather learns to love, and identify, again, and differently, reaching out to Paul across the gulf separating the butch lesbian author from the effeminate boy, in a way which critics such as Judith Butler and Christopher Nealon, as well as Sedgwick, have seen as potentially significant in marking a moment of a historical, as well as an individual’s affective shift, in which recognising a shared gay identity.(10)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;10) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 172.&lt;/span&gt; Away from gender toward sexual object choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	To consider this realignment is to consider only one aspect of Sedgwick’s essay which contains so many more, including a lovely reading of my favourite Cather novel, &lt;i&gt;The Professor’s House&lt;/i&gt;, in its final pages. What I’d like to stress here is that Sedgwick’s readings force us to remember that these sexuality and gender identifications, disidentifications and crossings, no matter how loudly proclaimed, are always tentative and initially unstable—reaching out and drawing back, they happen in odd spaces and in unpredictable formations. And that making these kinds of connections is also something that happens in the critic who watches, and cultivates them, who takes care, and cares for Paul, and for Cather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In her article about Sedgwick, ‘Two Girls, Fat and Thin’, Lauren Berlant writes “In the pleasure/knowledge economy of her work, the force of attachment has more righteousness than anything intelligibly or objectively ‘true’: She enables the refusal of cramped necessity by way of a poetics of misrecognition”.(11)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;11) Lauren Berlant, ‘Two Girls, Fat and Thin’, in Stephen M. Barber and David L. Clark, eds, &lt;i&gt;Regarding Sedgwick: Essays on Queer Culture and Critical Theory&lt;/i&gt; (London: Routledge, 2002), 71.&lt;/span&gt; In Sedgwick’s ‘Willa Cather and Others,’ I see that force of attachment at work, engaged in making and reflecting on, post-Wilde queer history by dismantling Cather’s previously clung-to cramped necessities,&amp;#8212;by allowing Cather, Cather’s readers, Sedgwick and her readers (us), to see Paul in that mirror, as he sees himself—a misrecognition which is also a very real recognition of possibilities, identifications, communities to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I wanted to return, finally to that “amazing tenderness of affirmation” that Sedgwick finds in Cather’s treatment of Paul, and by extension in her revision of her relation to Wilde. I wonder if we can’t also find an affirmation in the ambivalent title of the story—on the one hand, in that title Cather does appear to present Paul as a case history, diagnosable, deviant, always subject to the punitive gaze of the law or medicine even at the oddly described moment of his suicide. But on the other hand, as Sedgwick points out, Cather’s free indirect discourse also makes a case &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; Paul—the Paul in the mirror who is exactly the kind of boy he wants to be, and who the story, so briefly, but so pervasively, and persuasively, allows him to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Divinity: A Dossier, A Performance Piece, A Little Understood Emotion (Co-written with Michael Moon)&lt;br /&gt;
James Boaden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-JB.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Divinity: A Dossier, A Performance Piece, A Little Understood Emotion’ by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Michael Moon is a chapter that, twenty years on, requires a little context. The actor and singer Divine acts as an emblem for the chapter – to brutally reduce this long chapter’s argument &amp;#8211; in his body, the two authors find a divine coming together of the fat diva with the gay man, and suggest that, for some cross-dressers (to use their term), it is the body itself that suggests the donning of drag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their argument is made at a moment when drag had emerged as a major theme within feminist theory, and when the transvestite had become a much discussed icon. The text is written in order to directly engage with Marjorie Garber’s book &lt;i&gt;Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety&lt;/i&gt; and Elaine Showalter’s well-known, and much anthologised, essay ‘Critical Crossdressing: Male Feminists and the Woman of the Year’. The former text suggested, in part, that drag was a form of masquerade that could be donned and doffed at will as a form of critical gender play; Showalter for her part interrogated the way in which male critical theorists had suddenly taken up feminist tropes in their work and compared this to the movie &lt;i&gt;Tootsie&lt;/i&gt;, a film which concludes with the sentiment that the ideal woman is really a man. Sedgwick and Moon mention Judith Butler’s &lt;i&gt;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&lt;/i&gt; only in passing (it is referenced elsewhere in the book), yet it is the volume which set to bed Showalter’s qualms and argued that Garber’s observations could be understood in terms that went quite beyond play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a tendency to understand this moment in the early ‘90s when queer theory emerged – the moment so triumphantly heralded in the introduction to Sedgwick’s volume – as signalling the end of seperatist identity politics, within both theoretical writing and activism. This, of course, was never the aim of this work, as is spelled out in the introduction, yet it has been one way in which it has been caricatured. As with the narrative of waves of feminism, there is often an idea of a simplistic, almost adolescent version of gay and lesbian thinking that emerges in the 1970s in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, which is then brought to task in the shadow of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; crisis, and matures into the complexity of queer theory from the 1990s onwards. ‘Divinity’ is interesting for me for the way in which it looks at Divine’s work across the star’s lifetime and suggests that, at the moment of Gay Liberation, there were currents that could never fit this reductive way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter has been particularly useful for me in thinking through several current debates within queer theory about queer temporality, by authors such as Judith Halbertam, Elizabeth Freeman, Heather Love, Jose Munoz, Ann Cvetkovich, Christopher Reed and Christopher Castiglia, and a number of artists who have taken up their claims within their work. These writers look at the way in which queer work challenges conventional notions of temporality through strategies of revival, restaging, and an attention to the archive. Artists taking up these ideas include Conrad Ventur who has restaged Andy Warhol’s screentests, with particular attention paid to the trans superstar Mario Montez; Renate Lorenz and Pauline Boudry’s films and installations that engage with the photographic archive – reviving Arthur Munby and Hannah Cullwick’s images; or Alla Nazimova’s dance as Wilde’s Salome. Zackery Drucker’s work with Flawless Sabrina offers a rethinking of the drag pageants of the 1960s, while Liz Rosenfeld revives the work of the lesbian filmmaker Barbara Hammer. A.K. Burns and A.L. Steiner describe their work &lt;i&gt;Community Action Center&lt;/i&gt; as a “sociosexual video which incorporates the erotics of a community where the personal is not only political, but sexual”. They state &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;This project is a small archive of an intergenerational community built on collaboration, friendship, sex and art[… .T]he video seeks to expose and reformulate paradigms that are typical of porn typologies, intentionally exploiting tropes for their comical value, critical consideration and historical homage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these works sees the trans body as not only crossing genders, but traversing temporalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Burns and Steiner develop a pornographic visual lexicon from subcultural sexual practices that are often staged in the trappings of an imagined past. Moon and Sedgwick examine the way in which John Waters’ work with Divine reflects the development of a queer subculture in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; in the1970s, following the Stonewall rebellion. The films are far from the only reflections of this newly overground culture in the period. Moon understands Waters’ films of the ‘70s as derived from and contributing to a “whole range of novel and newly visible social and cultural practices of the time”, he sees gay men and lesbians as often at the vanguard of these practices. He lists radical drag; and glitter drag as a style of mass performance – naming Mick Jagger and David Bowie; exploitation films; collecting kitsch; cults of ‘sleeze’ including: anonymous public sex, S&amp;amp;M, golden showers, “performing, filming and consuming pornographic films, videos, and magazines”. Before going on to discuss the ambivalence with which Waters presents gay men in these films. Of course, these ‘practices’ as Moon calls them are far from the repertoire of ‘positive imagery’ which was associated with gay liberation of the 1970s by many activists and cultural producers working in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line between the celebration of sexual dissidence as it appeared at the queer moment outlined by Sedgwick in &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;’ introduction and earlier ‘positive representations’ is laid out by  B. Ruby Rich in her foundational article on the New Queer Cinema in 1991. Discussing the films of Todd Haynes, Tom Kalin, and Isaac Julien – which all used modes of pastiche &amp;#8211; she suggested that they definitively broke with “older humanist approaches and the films and tapes that accompanied identity politics”. What marks the contemporary art works that interest me is an embrace of Rich’s New Queer Cinema that also encompasses both the positive images of filmmakers associated with Gay Liberation, such as Barbara Hammer’s lesbian advertisements (to use her phrase), or the complex films of Rosa von Praunheim, as well as the contemporaneous dissidence represented by Waters’ films and the other examples I have shown in the powerpoint. Moon and Sedgwick seem to be, to some degree, anticipating recent queer archival works by the attention they bring to the indelible relationship between drag and queer sexuality and also their understanding of the materiality of the body itself. While disavowing essentialist notions of gender and sexual identity, they nonetheless understand that the body matters. The kind of archival queer work I am describing is perhaps most dramatically formulated in A.K. Burns and A.L. Steiner’s hour long video work &lt;i&gt;Community Action Center&lt;/i&gt;. For Burns and Steiner, certain gay male porn films of the 1970s, like those of Fred Halstead, represent an erotic body where sensation is spread not only right across its surface, but also outwards to the textures of inanimate objects. Burns and Steiner dress their pornographic fantasy not only in the leather trappings of the 1970’s S&amp;amp;M scene, but also garland it in the feathers and glitter that characterize the work of Jack Smith, Ulrike Ottinger, and the Cockettes.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The work’s call to the past is filled with apparent historical contradictions that disturb the way in which queer history has been written.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Midway through the film, there is an extended scene of masturbation with a comb of honey which takes place in a field of tall grass, honey dribbling over the body;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;later eggs drop from within a vagina into a flowing stream; other scenes take place deep within the woods.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Even when indoors the body is closely aligned with the natural world as feathers are sewn into the flesh of one of the protagonists in an act of becoming animal. This attachment of the body to nature can be understood as characteristic of the kind of lesbian cultural feminism that Barbara Hammer’s filmmaking has been associated with. Hammer is name-checked as an influence in several interviews the artists have given about the work; her 1974 film &lt;i&gt;Menses&lt;/i&gt; includes shots of a woman pushing an egg from her vagina while standing in a field that finds its echo in &lt;i&gt;Community Action Center&lt;/i&gt;. The commonly held idea is that this version of femininity linked to nature stands at odds with, or at least in a merely complementary role to, the world represented by the films of Fred Halstead, the world of leather bondage and the clone. Some of the fiercest debate within lesbian feminism in the early 1980s revolved around the critique of pornography and lesbian S&amp;amp;M. Too often, these debates seem to have been forgotten in the current return of ‘anti-raunch’ feminist literature. Rather than forgetting, &lt;i&gt;Community Action Center&lt;/i&gt; brings together the two strands of the debate not in order to weakly reconcile them, but rather to place them in powerful juxtaposition. It’s the same juxtaposition of past and future, transgression and affirmation, repulsion and desire that lies at the heart of Divine’s drag across three decades, and at the heart of his divinity recognized by Moon and Sedgwick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Nationalisms and Sexualities – As Opposed to What?&lt;br /&gt;
Helen Finch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-HF.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ‘Nationalisms and Sexualities – As Opposed to What?’, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick commented that the term “American had come, unbidden and remarked, to occupy a definitional center for almost every single one of the papers at a conference on Liberal Arts Education in 1988”. In my field of modern language studies, the question has been repeatedly asked as to whether ‘America’ has become the definitional centre for European queer studies. Leaving aside the vexingly paternalistic question of originality, this critique derived from an idea that the normative locus of queer studies is American theory, and that it is the duty of European and German art to respond to, and daringly demolish, this norm. I find this intriguing, not least given that Sedgwick’s textual reserves in this essay are sited firmly in the &lt;i&gt;locus classicus&lt;/i&gt; of turn-of-the-century European modernism – Wilde, Forster, Proust, Nietzsche. More of this anon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I want to talk about where I was situated when I encountered Eve’s work – how it might help me think through nationalities and genders. I was having a particularly torrid breakup with my PhD thesis on the German writer W. G. Sebald, and trying hard to find ways to move away from the seemingly all-enveloping melancholy readings to which his work was being subjected. I wanted to open a path to the affective, the sly, the robustly camp aspects of his work, but these were being read under a melancholy sign; the down-pushing melancholy in the dominant discourses surrounding his entanglements of German nation and queer love cast me into some despair. I wanted to think about how to rehabilitate queer utopias, how to evade this European hypostatisation of history as a natural history of destruction. Sedgwick suggested to me that I might need to look in two directions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-HF-figure.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think about the image of St. Sebastian. Sebastian is a seminal (used advisedly, or possibly inadvisably) figure in queer modernist iconography, and here I think particularly of &lt;i&gt;Death in Venice&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#8211; an intellectual and ephebe-like masculinity that stands silent in proud shame, clenching its teeth while it is pierced by swords and spears, but also a figure of penetrative jouissance. This St. Sebastian is attributed variously to the German painter Matthias Grünewald, and to another shadowy figure, Mathias Nithart.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt; In his 1988 poem ‘After Nature’, Sebald makes of this painting a figure of sameness that responds to what he calls the “painful division of the sexes” at the dawn of modernity; St. Sebastian was painted by two artists painting as one, and represents two artists in one homoerotic image. Here I quote from Michael Hamburger’s translation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;Indeed, it seemed as though in such works of art men had revered each other like brothers, and often made monuments in each other’s image where their paths had crossed.(1) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) W. G. Sebald, ‘After Nature’, in &lt;i&gt;The Rings of Saturn&lt;/i&gt;, tr. by Michael Hulse (London: Harvill, 1998), x. &lt;i&gt;After &lt;/i&gt;Nature, tr. by Michael Hamburger (London: Penguin, 2003), 6.&lt;/span&gt;Sebald mines this elective affinity as a political resource, by viewing Grünewald’s affiliation as a resistance to the strictures of emergent national masculinity. His Grünewald’s averted gaze is a refusal of the hubristic direct gaze of Renaissance man, his queered sexual orientation is a side-step away from the heterosexual norms of the times. The affection of German men for each other is framed by the narrator as a response firstly to the terrible separation of the genders enforced by the church, but also to the burden of gender itself: “The misfortune of saints is their sex”, says Sebald.(2) &lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sebald, &lt;i&gt;After Nature&lt;/i&gt;, 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is worrying, to me, about this productively queer re-reading of Grünewald is that Sebald’s Grünewald performs just the same definition of self versus other that Sedgwick queries towards the end of her essay. Grünewald is married to a Jewess, whom he rescues from the Frankfurt ghetto, but the marriage is unhappy and he forces her to take a Christian name. The Jewish woman becomes the victim of the victorious homoerotic bond between Grünewald and his chosen male brethren; Sebald’s Grünewald, at the beginning of modernity, repeats the intertwined logic of anti-Semitism and misogyny: the “womanless idyll” that Sedgwick later called it.(3) &lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Eve Koskofsky Sedgwick, ‘Anality: News from the Front’, in &lt;i&gt;The Weather in Proust&lt;/i&gt; (Durham: Duke University Press, 2011), 174.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebald’s modernist return to these foundational inscriptions of gender and nation thus has a double movement: retracing the anti-semitic, misogynist foundations of European modernity, and seeking solace in a meditation on the same. My answers to these questions are principally Deleuzo-Guattarian, and thus linked to the French critical theory that Sedgwick probed at a distance. But I also found that queer avuncularities can find a way to push against the strongly paranoid readings of queer sexualities that I was having thrust upon me. Turns out, I was ‘doing Eve’ already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dense moments of the same turn out, I would say, also to yield their pleasure. I am not sure whether, twenty years on, Sedgwick’s work has helped me resolve these knotty questions, but knowing that she was there before me – always already? &amp;#8211; has helped enormously in thinking through these problems of the same, and in gaining pleasure from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My happy ending to this queer affair with Sebald does not mean that these questions are all answered. Further, Sebald, like Sedgwick, turns to the problematics of Roger Casement, a figure who combines English exotifying, Irish nationalist and homosexual tendencies. In &lt;i&gt;The Rings of Saturn&lt;/i&gt;, Sebald writes a queer hagiography of the Irish nationalist who also engaged all his life in sexual relationships with adolescent boys from the countries where he carried out his human rights work. Sedgwick warns against “utopian misunderstandings of foreign nationalisms”, and Sebald’s hagiography of Casement falls under this category. But what are we to make of the fact that Casement has proven a rich resource for Irish queer rights activists, from novelist Colm Tóibín to unionist Jeffrey Dudgeon, but also for the most stultifyingly monotonous novel (&lt;i&gt;The Dram of the Celt) &lt;/i&gt;by the heterosexual Mario Vargas Llosa, who views Casement’s sexual engagements as a forgery? What do these forged inscriptions of queer modern Irishness serve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Sedgwick asks us to question the sameness of the Same – the homo nature of homosexuality – she also questions the creeping tyranny of the same surrounding contemporary national discourses of ‘gay rights’ in the U.K. Gay marriage rights become, in what Žižek would call “liberal communist” discourse, a marker of European sameness, distinguishing us from our intolerant, homophobic other.(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Slavoj Žižek, &lt;i&gt;On Violence: Six Sideways Reflections&lt;/i&gt; (London: Profile, 2009), 14.&lt;/span&gt; Sedgwick also asks what on earth it might mean to ‘have’ a nationality as one is supposed to ‘have’ a gender – the supposition behind the new equal marriage legislation is that one ‘has’ one gender and only one, although one may apply to have another under certain clearly defined circumstances. Sedgwick suggests “how ragged and unrationalizable may be not only the rights and entailments, but the definitional relations of the habitation/nation systems of the modern world”.(5) &lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 149.&lt;/span&gt; This question is becoming depressingly more pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; recently reported, queer asylum seekers to the UK are being forced into increasingly flamboyant publicisation of their sexuality in order to deflect deportation, including filming themselves having sex.(6)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Owen Bowcott, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/03/gay-asylum-seekers-pressure-prove-sexuality&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;‘Gay Asylum Seekers Feeling Increased Pressure to Prove Sexuality, Say Experts’&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; (February 3 2013), (Accessed February 3 2013).&lt;/span&gt; In such a situation, where the official dogma of the UK vaunts its tolerance by demanding that cis-gendered homosexuals become the same in socially-sanctioned dignity, while making the abject presentation of the stigmatised body of the asylum seeker a condition of their safety, then I think that we most certainly have need of recourse to Sedgwick’s tools of reading and attentiveness to the non-identical if we are not to become consumed in a double bind of nationalism and paranoia, not least paranoid &lt;i&gt;ressentiment&lt;/i&gt; towards those queers who &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;marry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we productively engage with the remapping of the homosexual British nation? Sedgwick says we need to look in more directions than one, athwart, and aslant. My excursis to Sebald has shown the pleasures and perils of looking backwards; my question becomes, how can we become a little less paranoid and a little more productive in our thinking about the same?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='squareleft' src='/images/preview/T20-ABr.jpg'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘A Poem Is Being Written’ beckons its readers through a mist of admissions and refusals towards a more experimental, a more personal, approach to critical writing. This chapter of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; explores poetry, sexuality, and gender through their relation to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s fantasies about spanking. In a serious and sustained attempt to outline these oblique correspondences, Sedgwick makes a series of surprising, unnerving, reassuring, mystifying, and, ultimately, enabling admissions. Reading this essay for the first time, I did not expect Sedgwick to let me read her own adolescent verse. Or to discover that, until she wrote this essay, she did not know exactly what a doorjamb was. Later I was surprised that Sedgwick identified, happily surprised that she &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; identify, across genders and across sexualities, “‘as’ a gay man”.(1)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;1) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 209.&lt;/span&gt; These admissions are tied to refusals: the refusal to settle on an essential, reducing identity; the refusal to &lt;i&gt;pretend&lt;/i&gt; to know; the refusal to enunciate a sexuality that is anything other than complex and riddled with opacities; and the refusal to recognize generic borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ‘A Poem Is Being Written’, these resistances allow Sedgwick to let theory, poetry, autobiography, and critical prose bleed into one another. The resulting essay, insofar as it is an essay, suspends a generative, fastidiously unresolved first person in dialogue between genres. The very title, ‘A Poem Is Being Written’, unbalances the generic standing of the piece of writing beneath it. It invites us to imagine a poem unfolding alongside, or even within, the essay we are reading. Sedgwick stresses that her “meditation on the punishing of children has occurred forward and backward across years, and across the gaps between poetry and theory – and so”, she concludes, “I’ll need to present it here”. But where, and what, exactly is “here”? Where are &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; when Sedgwick is writing her poem? According to her, “here” is “the ground of exception”, “the space of professional success and of hyperconscious virtuosity”. Here, then, is a generically indeterminate space somewhere between autobiography, criticism, and poetry. Here is where Sedgwick can outline a childhood poetics: a personal theory of enjambment that she associates with children being beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was a little child” Sedgwick writes, “the two most rhythmic things that happened to me were spanking and poetry”. In particular, she recalls spending hours – “probably really hundreds of hours – reading and rereading one bad poem by Louis Untermeyer”. The young Eve Kosofsky was “genuinely in love with something in this poem”: it gave her power. “The name of that power […] is, enjambment”.(2)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;2) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;181-182.&lt;/span&gt; Always precocious, the child who read and reread this poem was already writing poetry of her own. Untermeyer’s ‘Disenchanted’ gave her the power of enjambment to wield as a poet in her own right. The poetics that Sedgwick goes on to describe, and that she performs in the poetry that her essay quotes from, enfolds a fantasy of paralyzing discipline and masturbatory bliss between its line breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundaries of the highly specific spanking fantasies that Sedgwick recounts are carefully cauterized. She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;the spanking in my imagination has always occurred over a table, a table scaled precisely to the trunk of the child, framing it with a closeness and immobilizing exactitude that defined, for me both the English word &lt;i&gt;truncate&lt;/i&gt; and the French, of course, &lt;i&gt;tableau&lt;/i&gt;. The glamorized, inbreathing theatrical space of the spanking thus contracted to the framing of a single, striped, and sectioned midbody that wanted to move and mustn’t.(3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;3) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 183.&lt;/span&gt;A need for exact and rigid outlines transfixes this passage and contours the visuals of Sedgwick’s fantasy. Those phrases, “scaled precisely”, “framing it with a closeness”, “immobilizing exactitude”, “contracted to the framing”, and “sectioned midbody”, erotically delineate the borders of the child’s punished body. It is imperative in this fantasy that the figure of the child is “decontextualized”(4)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;4) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 183.&lt;/span&gt;, sealed-off, and visually abbreviated. Sedgwick imagines a poetics through this fantasy and ‘A Poem Is Being Written’ imbricates poetic form with this painstakingly stylized tableau:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;I visualized &lt;i&gt;enjambment&lt;/i&gt; very clearly as not only the poetic gesture of &lt;i&gt;straddling &lt;/i&gt;lines &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; syntactically, but also a pushing &lt;i&gt;apart&lt;/i&gt; of lines. In terms of the beating of the poem, enjambment was, in the fantasy that shaped my poetic, the thrusting up out of the picture plane in protest by the poem’s body of a syntactic thigh or shank that would intercept, would retard the numbered blow: would momentarily wedge apart with sense the hammering iteration of rhythm. Would say no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this passage, this refusal hovers around each line of Sedgwick’s poetry. Even if the line isn’t enjambed, I still look for traces of that “no”. Sedgwick’s critical prose, too, is shaped by poetic refusal. In a 1995 interview, Sedgwick said: “I see generic differences, but I strongly resist seeing categorical differences in the kind of undertakings theory and poetry are”. In what remains of this paper, I want to resist seeing separations between poetry and criticism, and use Sedgwick’s formalist erotics of enjambment to read a theory of quotation into ‘A Poem Is Being Written’. I want to suggest that the fantasy that binds Sedgwick’s poetic hints at the erotic potential of acts of quotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sedgwick’s imagination, the precisely delineated trunk of the disciplined child corresponds to the disciplining rhythms of the lyric. In my imagination, that trunk, framed with immobilizing exactitude, corresponds to the poems, and the cropped extracts of poems, that Sedgwick’s essay quotes from. Like the truncated bodies of her fantasies, punished over a table, the indented quotations from Sedgwick’s poetry that appear in ‘A Poem Is Being Written’ are sectioned, decontextualized, and roughly rectangular. Untermeyer’s “bad poem” is made an example of: cropped and chastised by Sedgwick’s critical prose. By placing her own poems within this chapter, and by indenting them, Sedgwick adheres to the typographical conventions of the critical essay that quotes poetry and in doing so sinks the fantasy that informs her poetry into her critical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a literary essay, indented quotation offers a critical counterpoint to, and a visual approximation of, “the thrusting out of the picture plane in protest by the poem’s body”. On the literary critical page, what thrusts out of the picture plane is not the space between the line breaks of a poem but the white, indented space separating poetry from prose. This space of indentation occurs between Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s prose and mine when I quote from her. In the fantasy of enjambment that Sedgwick’s essay enunciates, and the recalibrated fantasy of quotation that I imagine here, the fluctuating currents of critical power and authority oscillate across blank space. In this fantasy, when I crop and paralyze parts of this chapter of &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; through acts of quotation I preserve a series of numinous, intractable filaments of Sedgwick’s writing within my exegesis of it. As I attempt to change how Sedgwick’s essay might be understood I subject extracts from her work to my critical needs, pressures, and judgments. In this sense, the quotations I excise from ‘A Poem Is Being Written’ are, to an extent, at my mercy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her fantasy of spanking, Sedgwick figures this power relation in terms of directionality: “the frontality (to the viewer) of the &lt;i&gt;tableau&lt;/i&gt;” and the “backness (from the child) of the backside”.(5)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;5) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 198.&lt;/span&gt; She relates this directionality to her first, abbreviated reading of &lt;i&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/i&gt;, recalling that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;the reading was itself truncated – cut off, then &lt;i&gt;put&lt;/i&gt; off for a couple of decades – by the intensity of my pain, or excitement, or something, at the image of a child made to wear &lt;i&gt;on his back&lt;/i&gt; a placard, “&lt;i&gt;Take care of him. He bites.&lt;/i&gt;”(6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;6) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies, &lt;/i&gt;198.&lt;/span&gt;In this quotation, Sedgwick’s reading is truncated, relocated, and held at a contextual and temporal remove from &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;. What Sedgwick calls, the “potential for a terrifying involuntarity of meaning, in the body of a child”(7)&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;7) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 199.&lt;/span&gt; is nascent, both in her quotation from Dickens, and in my expropriation and extreme contraction of the body of her essay. Returning to “the placarded David”, Sedgwick writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;blocktext&quot;&gt;here, the potential excitations of something or somebody endlessly at, on, in one’s back, when they become palpable at all, must do so not only with but &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; an unappeasable anxiety (or alternatively depression) and shame of visibility.(8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginalnote&quot;&gt;8) Sedgwick, &lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt;, 199.&lt;/span&gt;To appropriate something of Sedgwick’s erotic here, there is a sense in which we are always behind what we read: we can read it; it can’t read us. The sentence I have just quoted part of above is subjected to a version of shameful visibility. My act of quotation has cut it in half and displayed it in a dilation of white space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in my acts of quotation above, I have striven to accurately replicate, to preserve the portion of the text that I reproduce in front of me. In doing this, I preserve the potential resistance in that quotation to the meaning I am trying to associate it with. Whatever I am writing around that extract, the quotation is saying something else; it has a different focus. One way or another (to different extents depending, perhaps, on who might be reading this essay behind &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; back) the contents of my quotations are saying “no”, they refuse to be wholly effaced by my reading. What ‘A Poem Is Being Written’ shows us is that critical sense doesn’t emanate from a direct and unimpeded top-down application of the critic’s meaning to a literary text. It comes from a dialogue between critical writing and its object of study. Sedgwick’s essay invites us to imagine this dialogue, bound by critical rigour but unconstrained by generic parameters and anxieties over propriety. In 2011, a previously unpublished essay that Sedgwick wrote around 1977 called ‘The 1001 Seances’ appeared in a special issue of &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GLQ&lt;/span&gt;: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies&lt;/i&gt;. Hal Sedgwick’s introduction to the essay warns readers that “the author of this essay might seem like an Eve before she was Eve”: an Eve at a contextual and temporal remove from what we might recognize or expect. For me, ‘A Poem Is Being Written’, is a snapshot of Eve becoming Eve: an account of the self that exists between genres, between lines, between Eves, and, when we quote from it, between us.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Center for the Humanities at The Graduate Center, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;, is hosting a monthly spring reading group (February 14-May 15) focused on the first section of Eve Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s book &lt;em&gt;The Weather in Proust&lt;/em&gt;. The first section, approximately three-quarters of the book, comprises Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s work on and around Proust. Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s rich and complex view of Proust emerges as she approaches his writing through discussions of topics such as Neoplatonism, Buddhism, Theory of Mind, autism, the poet C P Cavafy, Melanie Klein, and Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s own artwork, to name a few. The group will be led by H A Sedgwick and Joshua Wilner, and facilitated by a series of volunteers. Attendance at all five meetings is highly desirable, and participants will be asked to take an active part in the discussion. Enrollment is limited, so please register as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

To the contrary: For a writer whose prose (and thought) could often be astoundingly dense, circuitous, and lovingly (if sometimes frustratingly) devoted to articulating the farthest reaches of complexity, the overall effect of The Weather in Proust is one of great clarification and distillation. Indeed, for those unfamiliar with Sedgwick’s work, I would recommend starting with The Weather in Proust and moving backward from there, as the volume offers an enjoyably compressed, coherent, and retrospective portrait of Sedgwick’s principal preoccupations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This posthumous collection of Sedgwick’s essays presents readers with a glittering kaleidoscope of &amp;#8216;capacious concerns.&amp;#8217; Sedgwick, a pioneer in queer studies, shines as she contemplates Proust, textile art, and mortality in language that is challenging and exhilarating.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Publication of <i>The Weather in Proust</i></title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=48844&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Weather in Proust&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gathers pieces written by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in the last decade of her life. The book is edited by her longtime friend and literary executor, Jonathan Goldberg. From Duke University Press&amp;#8217;s website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This book takes its title from the first essay, a startlingly original interpretation of Proust. By way of Neoplatonism, Buddhism, and the work of Melanie Klein, Sedgwick establishes the sense of refreshment and surprise that the author of the &lt;i&gt;Recherche&lt;/i&gt; affords his readers. Proust also figures in pieces on the poetry of C. P. Cavafy, object relations, affect theory, and Sedgwick’s textile art practices. More explicitly connected to her role as a pioneering queer theorist are an exuberant attack against reactionary refusals of the work of Guy Hocquenghem and talks in which she lays out her central ideas about sexuality and her concerns about the direction of US queer theory. Sedgwick lived for more than a dozen years with a diagnosis of terminal cancer; its implications informed her later writing and thinking, as well as her spiritual and artistic practices. In the book’s final and most personal essay, she reflects on the realization of her impending death. Featuring thirty-seven color images of her art, &lt;i&gt;The Weather in Proust&lt;/i&gt; offers a comprehensive view of Sedgwick’s later work, underscoring its diversity and coherence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the time of her death after a long battle with cancer, Eve Sedgwick had been working on a book on affect and Proust, and on the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. This volume, edited by her friend and fellow-Series Q editor, Jonathan Goldberg, brings together a collection of her last work done since Duke&amp;#8217;s publication of &lt;i&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to her thoughts on affect, mind, Proust, and Klein, Sedgwick writes about Buddhism, her own artwork, and also looks back at her contributions to queer theory. Filled with luminous insight and Eve&amp;#8217;s singular prose, this will be the last book in Series Q.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Victorian Textures</title>
    <link href="/teaching/victorian-textures.html"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;English 80200: Victorian Textures&lt;br /&gt;
	Fall, 2001&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar will undertake to analyze textures in British Victorian material and literary culture.  Our first and continuing project will be to arrive at some working definitions of &amp;#8220;texture,&amp;#8221; including its relation to sight and touch, to scale, to structure and organization, to changing means and materials of production, to ornamentation, to sound, to colonial relations, to affects and sexualities, and to changing perceptual technologies.  &lt;br /&gt;
The readings of fiction and prose in the seminar will be aimed at developing a rich thematic sense of the textures of the material world of the Victorians, but simultaneously at understanding how the authors themselves use texture as a tool for gaining theoretical leverage on issues of history, class, imperial relations, spirituality, science and technology, gender and sexuality, labor and pleasure, and representation.  At the same time, the class will work on developing a vocabulary for the formal and phenomenological analysis of writerly texture itself.&lt;br /&gt;
Authors read will include Ruskin, Eliot, Dickens, Morris, Somerville and Ross, and James, along with relevant critical work by Renu Bora and Carol Mavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handout:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FRIDAY&lt;/span&gt;, Dec. 21: All papers due&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All auditors and enrolled students are required to &lt;br /&gt;
(1) keep up with the reading on a weekly basis, and &lt;br /&gt;
(2) speak in class at least once every week.  &lt;br /&gt;
Enrolled students are required to complete a mutually-agreed-on writing project.  Depending on where you are in your graduate work and what you want to use this class for, you have a variety of options for this project.  One possibility would be a reading journal, with weekly entries of  &amp;gt;5 pages recording your reflections on the current assignment, perhaps in relation to your other ongoing reading projects.  Or you might choose to write a full-dress (20-25 pp.) paper, which could be structured either around one or more of the texts studied, or around an encounter between another literary text and some of the material from this seminar.  Another possibility would be individual/small group research on some other aspect of Victorian textures.&lt;br /&gt;
I expect you to consult with me substantively, early, and often about the nature and progress of your writing project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Question Sets: For each class meeting, two students will sign up to prepare questions that will be used to guide the discussion of that week’s reading.  Please note that these are not to be formal presentations, much less papers delivered orally, but catalysts for seminar discussion.  The two students should discuss and coordinate their questions in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Papers: Open topic.  Although you have the full range of the novel to discuss, please remember that you retain last semester’s option for fragmentary, open, and/or experimental ways of organizing your writing for this project.  Please discuss your plans for this paper with me, early and often.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English 87100, Fall 2005&lt;br /&gt;
Class hours: Tues. 6:30-8:30.  Class room: 3309&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proust I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;br /&gt;
This is part I of a year-long seminar organized around a close, start-to-finish reading of Marcel Proust’s &lt;cite&gt;A la recherche du temps perdu&lt;/cite&gt; (In Search of Lost Time). We will be considering a wide range of the issues, motives, and ambitions embodied in the novel, including its complicated relation to the emerging discourses of Euro-American homosexuality. Other preoccupations that I hope will emerge through our discussions include the changing possibilities of novelistic genre; narratorial consciousness; texture; habit and addiction; experimental identities; meteorology; adult relations to childhood; the spatialities of present and past; the vicissitudes of gender; the bourgeois maternal in relation to such other roles as the grandmother, the aunt, the uncle, and a variety of domestic workers; alternatives to triangular desire; the languages of affect; phallic and non-phallic sexualities; the phenomenology and epistemology of sleep and dreams; the relations between Jewish diasporic being and queer diasporic being within modernism; and the affective, phenomenological, and philosophical ramifications of an interest in the transmigration of souls &amp;#8212; to name but a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some starting points:&lt;br /&gt;
Proust’s novel has been especially stimulating to readers interested in psychoanalysis and/or deconstruction. One emphasis of our reading this year will be on the potential usefulness of Melanie Klein’s ideas in understanding Proust’s novel. For this purpose, I am asking students to read Meira Likierman’s &lt;cite&gt;Melanie Klein: Her Work in Context&lt;/cite&gt; during the first several weeks of the semester. (Because Klein’s work both uses and differs from traditional [Freudian] psychoanalysis in important ways &amp;#8212; and because Freudian psychoanalysis has been so influential in twentieth-century readings of Proust &amp;#8212; students who don’t already have some background with psychoanalytic theory will want to read some Freud, as well. For our purposes I would especially suggest the following essays, to be found in [among other places] Peter Gay’s &lt;cite&gt;The Freud Reader&lt;/cite&gt;, a Norton paperback: “Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality”; “A Special Type of Object-Choice Made by Men”; “On the Universal Tendency to Debasement in the Sphere of Love”; “The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex”; and “Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming.”) For students who may not be familiar with deconstruction, I recommend Jonathan Culler’s &lt;cite&gt;On Deconstruction&lt;/cite&gt; as a good introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required texts:&lt;br /&gt;
For ease of discussion, all students are required to use the new translation of Proust edited by Christopher Prendergast (individual translations by Lydia Davis et al.). Either the British (Viking) or U.S. (Penguin) edition of this translation is fine, though their pagination may differ by two or three pages. (For next semester, please note that Volumes V and VI are unavailable in this country; you can buy them in Britain through amazon.co.uk, but leave plenty of time to get them.) Those who wish to may supplement the translation by reading along in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcel Proust, &lt;cite&gt;In Search of Lost Time vol. I, The Way By Swann’s&lt;/cite&gt; (called Swann’s Way in U.S. edition), tr. Lydia Davis.&lt;br /&gt;
Marcel Proust, &lt;cite&gt;In Search of Lost Time vol. II,  In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower&lt;/cite&gt;, tr. James Grieve.&lt;br /&gt;
Marcel Proust, &lt;cite&gt;In Search of Lost Time vol. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;, The Guermantes Way&lt;/cite&gt;, tr. Mark Treharne.&lt;br /&gt;
Meira Likierman, &lt;cite&gt;Melanie Klein: Her Work in Context&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class meetings:&lt;br /&gt;
The reading schedule for the first semester follows.  Please focus on the section assigned for each class session; we won’t be able to pursue our strategy of close reading if we aren’t all reading/discussing the same passages at the same time.  &lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, please note that we will be taking an unconventional itinerary through the first volume of the novel: we’re going to read “A Love of Swann’s” before we go back and read “Combray.” I have made this choice because it is so common to see “Combray” isolated and fetishized in discussions of  Proust, often with disastrous results for the critical assumptions and proceedings that then get applied to the rest of the novel. I’m hoping by this rather drastic intervention at least to deroutinize our sense of how “Combray” is related to the other sections of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readings: &lt;br /&gt;
1)  All page numbers below are for the British (Viking) edition–may be off a couple of pages from U.S. (Penguin) edition.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Please don’t read the introductions to each volume–they contain plot spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8/30: Introductory class&lt;br /&gt;
9/6: Vol. I, pp. 191-324.  “A Love of Swann’s”: The Verdurins and their little clan, up to the Marquise de Saint-Euverte’s party.&lt;br /&gt;
9/13: Vol. I, pp. 324-383.  “A Love of Swann’s”: To end of section.  Then: Vol. I, pp. 7-50.  “Combray” section 1: awakenings; bedtimes at Combray; the madeleine.&lt;br /&gt;
9/19: Vol. I, pp. 51-166.  “Combray,” section 2: Aunt Léonie’s two rooms, to end of the scene with Mlle. Vinteuil.&lt;br /&gt;
9/26: Vol. I, pp. 166-187.  To the end of “Combray.”  Then: Vol. I, pp. 387-430.  “Place-Names: The Name.”  Entire section.&lt;br /&gt;
10/4: No class&lt;br /&gt;
10/11: No class.&lt;br /&gt;

12/13: Vol. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;, pp. 464-597. “Part Two,” to end of volume.  &lt;br /&gt;
12/20: Papers due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assignments:&lt;br /&gt;
1) All students (including auditors) are required to contribute orally in every class meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Final project: The focus of this semester is on the first half of A la recherche, so I do not encourage students to undertake a full-dress paper that would presume a knowledge of the novel as a whole.  Instead, you’ll need to use your ingenuity to come up with a writing project that makes sense in the context of what you have read.  Please discuss your project ideas with me by November 15 at the latest.  I encourage experimental forms and collaborative projects as appropriate.  All final papers are due in my mailbox by 5 p.m. on December 20.&lt;br /&gt;
3) In addition, from time to time I may ask various seminar participants (both enrolled and auditing) to come prepared to lead a brief discussion of a short passage of their choice in that week’s reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Bal, Mieke, &lt;cite&gt;The Mottled Screen: Reading Proust Visually&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Works in Fiber, Paper, and Proust</title>

    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/art/fiber-paper-proust_exhibition</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;from the artist&amp;#8217;s statement:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pieces in this show emerge from a decades-long engagement with Marcel Proust&amp;#8217;s novel, &lt;i&gt;A la recherche du temps perdu,&lt;/i&gt; but they are not meant either to illustrate the book or to evoke its time, place, or atmospheres. The show&amp;#8217;s title reflects my interest in using Proust&amp;#8217;s language and thought as a medium, one with texture and materiality comparable to other artistic media, that can be manipulated through various processes to show new aspects. But if these are works &amp;#8220;in&amp;#8221; Proust in the same sense that they&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;in&amp;#8221; fiber or paper, they also reflect the transformative potential of a prolonged immersion in someone else&amp;#8217;s mental world, a way of being &amp;#8220;in Proust.&amp;#8221; I am especially interested in the dailiness of a mysticism that doesn&amp;#8217;t rely on the esoteric or occult, but on simple material metamorphoses as they are emulsified with language and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bodhisattva Fractal World</title>
    <link href="/art/bodhisattva-fractal-world-exhibition.html"/>
    <updated>2011-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/art/bodhisattva-fractal-world-exhibition</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;from the artist&amp;#8217;s statement:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This textile show explores the contemplative space generated by the thousand-year-old sculptural images of Kuan-Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion in Chinese Buddhism. Also known as Avalokiteshvara in Sanskrit and as Kannon in Japanese, Kuan-Yin, like other bodhisattvas, has a complex ontological standing: among others, as a future or past Buddha, and as an enlightened being who has vowed to forego Nirvana until all other beings have become enlightened. In popular Chinese devotion – not only among Buddhists – Kuan-Yin is still occupied daily in protecting beings and dispensing good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many people, the Kuan-Yin sculpture of the late T&amp;#8217;ang and Sung (around the turn of the last millennium) exerts a powerful influence. The period was also a transitional one in human understandings of Kuan-Yin: up to about the eighth century, the bodhisattva was usually portrayed as a man, while after about the twelfth century, Kuan-Yin in China was generally seen and known in female form. The magnetic Kuan-Yins of the intervening centuries are often much harder to classify in terms of gender. My own thought and hope is that, even in the expression of a strong sensuality, many of these regal and loved divinities may not have been shaped or perceived through the eyes of gender at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Kuan-Yin became so popular in China is thought to have been the bodhisattva&amp;#8217;s responsiveness to certain currents in Taoist thought and iconography. The pieces in &amp;#8220;Bodhisattva Fractal World&amp;#8221; come out of an aesthetic, what the Japanese call wabi-sabi, that similarly resonates with the Tao. The near-aleatory effects of suminagashi (ink floated on water) and the fractal dimension-bending of shibori (bound resist dyeing), like the subtly unfolding haiku of Zen monks nearing the end of their lives, suggest many connections between contemporary understandings of chaos and complexity, on the one hand, and on the other, a group of ancient East Asian embodiments of wisdom and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The question of affect is central to critical theory, psychology, politics, and the entire range of the humanities; but no discipline, including psychoanalysis, has offered a theory of affect that would be rich enough to account for the delicacy and power, the evanescence and durability, the bodily rootedness and the cultural variability of human emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silvan Tomkins (1911–1991) was one of the most radical and imaginative psychologists of the twentieth century. In &lt;em&gt;Affect, Imagery, Consciousness&lt;/em&gt;, a four-volume work published over the last thirty years of his life, Tomkins developed an ambitious theory of affect steeped in cybernetics and systems theory as well as in psychoanalysis, ethology, and neuroscience. The implications of his conceptually daring and phenomenologically suggestive theory are only now &amp;#8212; in the context of postmodernism &amp;#8212; beginning to be understood. With &lt;em&gt;Shame and Its Sisters&lt;/em&gt;, editors Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank make available for the first time an engaging and accessible selection of Tomkins’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featuring intensive examination of several key affects, particularly shame and anger, this volume contains many of Tomkins’s most haunting, diagnostically incisive, and theoretically challenging discussions. An introductory essay by the editors places Tomkins’s work in the context of postwar information technologies and will prompt a reexamination of some of the underlying assumptions of recent critical work in cultural studies and other areas of the humanities. The text is also accompanied by a biographical sketch of Tomkins by noted psychologist Irving E. Alexander, Tomkins’s longtime friend and collaborator. -&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Queerer than Fiction</title>
    <link href="/writing/queerer-than-fiction.html"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last paragraphs of Freud&amp;#8217;s essay on the paranoid Dr. Schreber, there is discussion of what Freud considers a &amp;#8220;striking similarity&amp;#8221; between Schreber&amp;#8217;s persecutory delusion and Freud&amp;#8217;s own theory. Freud was indeed later to generalize, famously, that &amp;#8220;the delusions of paranoiacs have an unpalatable external similarity and internal kinship to the systems of our philosophers&amp;#8221; – among whom he included himself. For all his characteristic slyness, it may be true that the putative congruence between paranoia and theory was unpalatable to Freud. In the hands of subsequent thinkers, however, it has by now become less an embarrassment than a prescriptive article of faith: for literary and cultural critics, the prevailing theoretical challenge has been to find ever more subtle and searching ways of implementing a hermeneutic of suspicion. In a world where no one need be delusional to find evidence of systemic oppression, to theorize out of anything but a paranoid critical stance has come to seem naive or complaisant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even aside from the prestige that now attaches to a hermeneutic of suspicion in critical theory as a whole, queer studies in particular has had a distinctive history of intimacy with the paranoid imperative. Freud, of course, traced every instance of paranoia to the repression of same-sex desire, whether in women or in men. A chain of powerful, against-the-grain responses to Freud&amp;#8217;s argument, beginning with Guy Hocquenghem&amp;#8217;s &lt;cite&gt;Homosexual Desire&lt;/cite&gt;, has established the paranoid stance as a uniquely privileged one for understanding not – as in the Freudian tradition – homosexuality itself, but rather precisely the mechanisms of homophobic and heterosexist enforcement against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subversive and demystifying parody, suspicious archaeologies of the present, the detection of hidden patterns of violence and their exposure: these infinitely doable and teachable protocols of unveiling have become the common currency of cultural and historicist studies, and signs in turn of the special status that queer and antihomophobic inquiry seems to hold within that movement. If there is any obvious danger in the triumphalism of a hermeneutic of suspicion, it is that the broad consensual sweep of such methodological assumptions, the current near-profession-wide agreement about what constitutes narrative or explanation or adequate historicization, may, if it persists unquestioned, unintentionally impoverish the gene-pool of literary-critical perspectives and skills. The trouble with a narrow gene-pool, of course, is its diminished ability to respond to environmental (for instance, political) change. Another danger of the present paranoid consensus, however, is that it may require the disarticulation, disavowal, and misrecognition of other ways of reading – ways less oriented around suspicion – that are actually being practiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One premise of the present collection is that a closer, more respectful attention to past and present queer reading practices – the kind of attention these essays, in their different ways, all embody – will show how the reservoir of practices already in use crucially exceeds the theorizations of a consensual hermeneutic of suspicion. Many of these essays are, rightly, incisive and unerring in their methodical suspicion; but what more unites them is a very different impulse and history, which would be badly misrecognized under the currently available rubrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps instead of battening on the Freudian understanding of paranoia, for all its useful definitional linkage to homoerotic issues, it would be more descriptive here to use Melanie Klein&amp;#8217;s less differentiated, arguably less elegant concept of the paranoid position. The interest of Klein&amp;#8217;s concept lies, it seems to me, in her seeing the paranoid position always in the oscillatory context of a very different possible one, the depressive/reparative position. For Klein&amp;#8217;s infant or adult, the paranoid position – understandably marked by hatred, envy, and anxiety – is a position of terrible alertness to the dangers posed by hateful and envious part-objects that one cannot help but ingest from the world around one. By contrast, the depressive/reparative position is an anxiety-mitigating achievement that the infant or adult only sometimes, and briefly, succeeds in inhabiting: this is the position from which it is possible in turn to use one&amp;#8217;s own resources to assemble or &amp;#8220;repair&amp;#8221; the murderous part-objects into something like a whole (though not necessarily like any preexisting whole). Once assembled to one&amp;#8217;s own specifications, the more satisfying object is available both to be identified with and to offer one nourishment in turn. Among Klein&amp;#8217;s names for the reparative process is love.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Performativity and Performance</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is saying something doing something? And how is saying something doing something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the age of Aristotle to the age of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;, writers, thinkers, performers and activists have wrestled with what the question of &amp;#8220;performance&amp;#8221; is all about.  Suddenly, theater studies has transformed itself from the study of plays to the study of performance. At the same moment, &amp;#8220;performativity&amp;#8221; – a new concept in language theory – has become a ubiquitous term in literary studies. What do these transformations have to do with one another? Is &amp;#8220;performativity&amp;#8221; necessarily theatrical? Are performances necessarily performative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This volume of new work, by leading scholars in a wide range of fields, grapples with the nature of these two key terms, whose traces can be found everywhere: in the theater, in the streets, in philosophy, in issues of race and gender, in the sentences we speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essays reexplore the classical definition of katharsis, its reinvention in Renaissance performance, in the circum-Atlantic cultures and in African American literature, JL Austin’s language theory, ideas in twentieth-century performance, and the performative nature of language in activism and hate-speech legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2011-05-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/writing/novel-gazing</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Novel Gazing&lt;/em&gt; is the first collection of queer criticism on the history of the novel. The contributors to this volume navigate new territory in literary theory with essays that implicitly challenge the &amp;#8220;hermeneutic of suspicion&amp;#8221; widespread in current critical theory. In a stunning introductory essay, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick delineates the possibilities for a criticism that would be &amp;#8220;reparative&amp;#8221; rather than cynical or paranoid. The startlingly imaginative essays in the volume explore new critical practices that can weave the pleasures and disorientations of reading into the fabric of queer analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through discussions of a diverse array of British, French, and American novels – including major canonical novels, best-sellers, children’s fiction, and science fiction – these essays explore queer worlds of taste, texture, joy, and ennui, focusing on such subjects as flogging, wizardry, exorcism, dance, Zionist desire, and Internet sexuality. Interpreting the works of authors as diverse as Benjamin Constant, Toni Morrison, T. H. White, and William Gibson, along with canonical queer modernists such as James, Proust, Woolf, and Cather, contributors reveal the wealth of ways in which selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them. The dramatic reframing that these essays perform will make the significance of Novel Gazing extend beyond the scope of queer studies to literary criticism in general. -&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributors: Stephen Barber, Renu Bora, Anne Chandler, James Creech, Tyler Curtain, Jonathan Goldberg, Joseph Litvak, Michael Lucey, Jeff Nunokawa, Cindy Patton, Jacob Press, Robert F. Reid-Pharr, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Melissa Solomon, Kathryn Bond Stockton, John Vincent, Maurice Wallace, Barry Weller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This invaluable and substantial collection opens with a typically spirited essay on &amp;#8216;paranoid reading&amp;#8217; by Sedgwick, whose own pathbreaking analysis of the &amp;#8216;paranoid Gothic&amp;#8217; has transformed how we understand sexuality in that particular genre&amp;#8230; The impressive essays that follow feature several discussions addressing nineteenth-century literature, including Jeff Nunokawa on ennui in Wilde’s &lt;em&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt; and John Vincent on Swinburne’s &lt;em&gt;Lesbia Brandon.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; -&lt;cite&gt;Nineteenth-Century Literature&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sedgwick is such a powerful critic of literary studies and of sexuality because she recognizes where interpretive possibilities have been foreclosed and points to how they might be reopened.&amp;#8221; -&lt;cite&gt;Andrew Elfenbein, Modern Philology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The close textual inquiry and observations are so well done that a number of these essays should define new debates within the study of the novel at hand&amp;#8230; This astonishing collection deserves wide reading and discussion.&amp;#8221; -&lt;cite&gt;D.N.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The incandescent African American writer Gary Fisher was completely unpublished when he died of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; in 1994 at the age of thirty-two. This volume, which includes all of Fisher’s stories and a generous selection from his journals, notebooks, and poems, will introduce readers to a tender, graphic, extravagant, and unswervingly incisive talent. In Fisher’s writings the razor-sharp rage is equalled only by the enveloping sweetness; the raw eroticism by a dazzling writerly elegance. Evocations of a haunting and mobile childhood are mixed in Fisher’s stories with an X-ray view of the racialized sexual vernaculars of gay San Francisco; while the journals braid together the narratives of sexual exploration and discovery, a joyous and deepening vocation as a writer, a growing intimacy with death, and an engagement with racial problematics that becomes ever more gravely and probingly imaginative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A uniquely intimate, unflinching testimony of the experience of a young, African American gay man in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; emergency, &lt;em&gt;Gary in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt; includes an introduction by Don Belton that describes Fisher’s achievement in the context of other work by Black gay men such as Marlon Riggs and Essex Hemphill, and a biographical afterword by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. -&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is impossible to read &lt;cite&gt;Gary in Your Pocket&lt;/cite&gt; and not marvel at [Fisher’s] talent&amp;#8230;. Here is the unfolding world of a young gay man of the post-Stonewall generation, learning to embrace a gay identity with innocence and without shame&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;Gary in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt; redefines the dimensions of African American literature. The body of black gay literature is all the more so enriched.&amp;#8221; -&lt;cite&gt;Mark Haile, Lambda Book Report&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The importance of Gary Fisher’s work cannot be overstated. Presenting a singular and now lost artist, &lt;em&gt;Gary in Your Pocket&lt;/em&gt; adds much needed insight into the forum of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; and sexuality. It will handily transcend any normal sense of audience or perceived notions of appeal.&amp;#8221; -&lt;cite&gt;Randall Kenan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (1950-2009) was a poet, artist, literary critic and teacher. She is perhaps best known as one of the originators of Queer Theory. Her work and her example continue to have a significant effect in shaping the lives and thought of many people. Sedgwick had little wanderlust, but she had a strong desire to find or create places that would give her both the freedom and the support that she needed. Each of the places that she lived had a strong and complex character for her &amp;#8212; sometimes attractive, sometimes not &amp;#8212; and each helped to shape her life there. This brief biography follows her from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Dayton: 1950 to 1957&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve Kosofsky was born on May 2, 1950, at Good Samaritan Hospital, in Dayton, Ohio. Her parents, Leon Kosofsky and Rita Goldstein Kosofsky, were both natives of Brooklyn, New York, and graduates of Brooklyn College. The only members of their respective families to live outside of New York City, they were among the relatively few Jews living in Dayton, where Leon worked at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a civilian photogrammetrist specializing in aerial reconnaissance. Eve was a middle child: her sister Nina was born in 1947; her brother David in 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve attended public schools in Dayton for two years: kindergarten and second grade, skipping first grade due to her early mastery of reading and general intellectual precocity. She took ballet lessons, made paintings and drawings inspired by art reproductions her parents borrowed each month from the Dayton Museum of Art, and by the age of seven had decided that she would be a poet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Bethesda: 1957 to 1967&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1957 Leon Kosofsky was offered a position with the Army Map Service, doing the same sort of photogrammetric work as in Dayton. The salary and advancement possibilities were somewhat better, but the real lure was location: the relatively cosmopolitan Washington, D.C. area. So, when Eve was seven, the family moved to a house in Bethesda, Maryland, inside the not-yet-completed Beltway, where she spent the next decade of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to Bethesda coincided with the launch of Sputnik and the start of the &amp;#8216;Space Race&amp;#8217; between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., leading directly to the establishment of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. For Leon, the transition from aerial reconnaissance to orbital photography was natural, and the opportunity to move from the military culture of the Army Map Service to the newly chartered civilian agency was irresistible. Joining &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in the early sixties, he became Program Engineer for the Lunar Orbiter program of unmanned photographic satellites. Leon created maps of the moon to help locate places for manned missions to land, and aided in the photographic analysis of lunar geology. He reported the results of his work in a book, &lt;cite&gt;The Moon as Viewed by Lunar Orbiter&lt;/cite&gt;, published by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bethesda, Eve attended Montgomery County public schools. At Wyngate Elementary School she continued to pursue her chosen vocation as a poet. Her essay &amp;#8220;A poem is being written&amp;#8221; (&lt;cite&gt;Tendencies&lt;/cite&gt;, 1993) examines her development as a poet. It begins &amp;#8220;This essay was written late: twenty-seven years late, to the extent that it represents a claim for respectful attention to the intellectual and artistic life of a nine-year-old child, Eve Kosofsky.&amp;#8221; Indeed it was at that age, when she was in fifth grade, that Eve produced a small anthology of her poems, entitled &amp;#8220;Exiles and Fugitives,&amp;#8221; bound in a cover illustrated with her own drawing. Only a few of Eve&amp;#8217;s poems from this period are known to have survived&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Wyngate, Eve went on to North Bethesda Junior High School and Walter Johnson High School. She served as poetry editor for her high school&amp;#8217;s literary magazine, to which she also contributed several poems. Other extra-curricular activities included Forensics Club and Drama Club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the former, she participated in inter-scholastic competitions, specializing in an event called &amp;#8216;Extemporaneous Speaking,&amp;#8217; where competitors were required to give original, and largely spontaneous speeches on topics made known to them only shortly before. Her abundant creativity and verbal fluency carried her past the handicap of her natural shyness, and Eve excelled; the same process was evident in her teaching and public speaking throughout her career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although her Drama Club activities entailed relatively little actual performance in high-school productions, Eve&amp;#8217;s involvement in theater during those years had an important influence on the development of her interests. Specifically, she took summer courses at the Washington Theater Club, at that time an organization with a commitment to the innovative staging of socially consequential plays in an intimate performance space: a converted carriage house in the Dupont Circle/Georgetown section of Washington. Within that milieu, Eve found herself drawn to a constellation of personal qualities and styles that she described at the time as &amp;#8216;theatrical&amp;#8217;. In retrospect, she would speak of her Washington Theater Club experience as a richly formative awakening of her awareness of, and attraction to, a gay sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Bethesda years, with her husband engaged in lunar exploration and her growing children requiring less of her energy, Rita Kosofsky pursued a career in a direction related to Eve&amp;#8217;s developing interests. Building on her undergraduate degree in English, Rita took graduate courses at the University of Maryland, earning an M.A. in English Literature. Her master&amp;#8217;s thesis was published as a book, &lt;cite&gt;Bernard Malamud: An Annotated Checklist,&lt;/cite&gt; by Kent University Press in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attending graduate school, Rita worked for the Montgomery County public schools as a non-teaching &amp;#8216;lay reader&amp;#8217; grading high-school students&amp;#8217; English compositions. Eve often helped in this work, making corrections and suggesting improvements on essays and term papers written by students several years older. During her senior year at Walter Johnson, Eve won the National Council of Teachers of English award; that same year, Eve&amp;#8217;s mother began her career as a high-school English teacher in another Montgomery County school. Recognized for her talent in teaching gifted students, Rita went on to design the curriculum for Honors English courses at Walt Whitman High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1966, following her junior year in high school, Eve attended a six-week summer program at Cornell University. The program was run by the Telluride Association, which also maintained a scholarship house for talented Cornell students. Following Eve&amp;#8217;s summer program, she was offered a scholarship at Telluride House, which led to her entering Cornell in the fall of 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ithaca: 1967 to 1971&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telluride House was established in 1910 as an institution for men only. In the 1960s it was gradually making the transition to accepting women as well. During Eve’s first year at Cornell, undergraduate women were not yet allowed to sleep at Telluride House although they took their meals there and participated in all of the activities of the house. So Eve had a room in a Cornell dormitory. The following year she was permitted to stay at the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications to Telluride summer programs, and to Telluride House, were reviewed by students currently living in the house. One of these students was Hal Sedgwick, who thus first came to know Eve through her writing. In the fall of 1967 Hal entered graduate school at Cornell and moved out of Telluride House. He continued to spend time at the house, however, to visit Eve and his other friends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1969, following her sophomore year, Eve and Hal were married. For their remaining two years at Cornell, they lived in the attic of a farmhouse in the countryside near the town of Brooktondale, a few miles from Ithaca. The farmhouse belonged to Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell professor whose work on &amp;#8220;perceptrons&amp;#8221; pioneered the early study of the computational abilities of neural networks. Rosenblatt rented the rooms in his house at nominal rates to an ever-shifting population of six or eight friends and students, and the house was run quasi-communally, with its residents taking turns making dinner for the whole group. After dinner everyone remained around the dinner table while Frank read to them another chapter or two from some book he had selected for their entertainment (&lt;cite&gt;The Wind in the Willows&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Once and Future King&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Giles Goat-Boy&lt;/cite&gt;, and so forth). The Brooktondale community was a formative model for Sedgwick’s conception of the non-nuclear, non-biological family, as Frank Rosenblatt was one of her models of the bachelor &amp;#8220;uncle.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cornell Sedgwick was accepted into a college-wide honors program that allowed her to shape her own course of study and to largely avoid the college’s distribution requirements. (What could not be avoided was the two-year physical education requirement, which Sedgwick satisfied by taking archery in the mild weather and ice skating in the cold weather, two activities in which she became highly proficient.) Sedgwick concentrated on English literature, taking many courses and seminars in that area. Most importantly, she took several seminars with Neil Hertz, who strongly influenced her thinking and became a lifelong friend. A year-long seminar in poetry writing with A. R. Ammons, whose poetry she admired, led to the writing of a substantial number of poems, many of which are still unpublished. Another important influence was Allan Bloom, a political philosopher and student of Leo Strauss. Sedgwick took several courses and seminars from Bloom, who had a close connection with Telluride House and drew a number of Sedgwick’s friends there into careers as Straussian political philosophers. Sedgwick discusses her fascination with Bloom in &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/cite&gt;. Sedgwick also studied anthropology (with James Seigel), history of psychology (with Robert MacLeod), and diverse other courses such as mathematical logic. Sedgwick graduated summa cum laude from Cornell in June of 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;New Haven: 1971 to 1976&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve Sedgwick entered the Ph.D. program in English at Yale in the fall of 1971. At the same time Hal Sedgwick began a post-doctoral fellowship in New York City and later took up a faculty position there. After a brief attempt at living with Hal in suburban Westchester county and commuting to New Haven, Eve found a room near the Yale campus in New Haven. This was the beginning of a long-distance, weekend relationship with Hal that continued for over twenty-six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick was drawn to Yale by the strength of its reputation in literary theory, particularly the then-new theory of deconstruction. She studied with Paul de Man, Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartman, and J. Hillis Miller, among others. Yale graduate school was not a particularly happy experience for Sedgwick. She experienced the faculty as remote, and received little recognition of her abilities. Determined not to linger, she finished her graduate studies in four years, submitting a dissertation (&lt;cite&gt;The Coherence of Gothic Conventions&lt;/cite&gt;) to a committee chaired by Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick was much happier with her fellow graduate students, forming sustaining, and lasting, friendships with Jonathan Kamholtz, Joseph Gordon, and several others, and continuing from Cornell her close friendships with Josh Wilner and Marsha Hill. She also continued to write and publish poetry during her years in New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;Modern Language Association&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt;, which held its annual convention during the last week of December, was the main job market for academic positions in English literature.  Sedgwick first attended the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt; as a job seeker, beginning in 1970 and for many years thereafter.  Later, the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt; became the most public forum for her work, including the much commented on (and deplored)  “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl”.  Sedgwick also became active in the administrative structure of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt;, serving as a member, then co-chair, of their Commission on the Status of Women in the Profession (1983-86), as a member, then chair, of the Executive Committee of the Division on Gay Studies in Language and Literature (1986-90), and as a member of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt; Executive Council (1996-99).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The completion of her Ph.D. marked the beginning of Sedgwick’s long efforts to obtain a stable academic position. Over the following nine years Sedgwick submitted innumerable job applications. She once estimated that she had had over a hundred job interviews, almost all of which were unsuccessful. She remarked, however, that she had made many friends, even from the unsuccessful applications, and had learned a great deal about the process. She later wrote a pamphlet, published by the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt;, with advice for graduate students on the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to find a job, Sedgwick was given a one-year lectureship by Yale, and remained in New Haven for the 1975-76 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Ithaca again: 1976 to 78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1976 Sedgwick returned to Ithaca with a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship in English and creative writing at Cornell. While in Ithaca, Sedgwick continued to work on the subject of her dissertation, substantially revising its first chapter, and working on a new paper on “the character in the veil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also published several poems in literary journals and completed the manuscript of a book of her poetry: &lt;cite&gt;Traceable, Salient, Thirsty&amp;#8230;.&lt;/cite&gt; After numerous efforts, however, and in spite of some positive reviews, she was unable to find a publisher for the book. Years later some of the poems from that manuscript appeared in &lt;cite&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/cite&gt;. Others remain unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Cornell, Sedgwick also engaged in an extended study of the poetry and other writing of James Merrill. This resulted in the paper &amp;#8220;1001 Seances.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick was strongly attracted to Ithaca, and even after she had moved away she returned to live there for several summers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Clinton: 1978 to 81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick’s first faculty position was at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton College, founded in 1812, was for men only until 1978. In 1968, Hamilton had participated in establishing Kirkland College as an adjacent, independent college for women. After ten years, financial difficulties forced Kirkland to accept a merger with Hamilton, which then became co-ed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of Kirkland’s faculty were retained in the merger, others were not. The response of the Hamilton English Department to its new responsibility of educating women was to hire several women faculty members on non-tenure track positions (two years, potentially renewable for two more years). It was in this marginalized position, Sedgwick later said, that she learned feminism. She and a number of other women faculty across several departments joined together, calling themselves Faculty for Women’s Concerns, to work toward improving the situation of women faculty and students at Hamilton. The group acted as a collective, refusing to identify either a leader or a spokesperson, and signing all of their communications to the college administration simply &amp;#8220;Faculty for Women’s Concerns.&amp;#8221; This disconcerting strategy may have contributed to the FWC’s success in winning substantial support for its projects from the administration. Sedgwick formed several deep and lasting friendships with members of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FWC&lt;/span&gt;, including Janet Halley, Nancy Rabinowitz, Elaine Hansen, and Elizabeth Potter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she was at Hamilton, Sedgwick published her revised dissertation. She also published her first major critical article, &amp;#8220;The Character in the Veil: Imagery of the Surface in the Gothic Novel.&amp;#8221; This article, which she had been writing during her Mellon fellowship, appeared in the prestigious &lt;cite&gt;Publications of the Modern Language Association&lt;/cite&gt;. It succeeded in being accepted for publication, Sedgwick believed, because of the &lt;cite&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PMLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&amp;#8216;s newly adopted policy of sending out articles for review without identifying either the name or the institution of the author, thus hampering the operation of the &amp;#8217;old-boys&amp;#8217; club&amp;#8217; that had dominated its pages. Sedgwick continued to write and publish poetry, including &amp;#8220;Sexual Hum&amp;#8221; and the novella-length narrative poem &amp;#8220;Trace at 46.&amp;#8221; In 1978 she began work on a book-length poem, &amp;#8220;The Warm Decembers,&amp;#8221; that she was (as she wrote in her note to the poem) &amp;#8220;to regard as current work&amp;#8221; for the following decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond her positive experiences with her friends in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FWC&lt;/span&gt;, Sedgwick found little to attract her to Hamilton and was eager to get out of Clinton before her four-year term expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Boston: 1981 to 1984&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1981, Sedgwick joined the English Department of Boston University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘tenure-track’ designation was only nominal, however. The decade prior to Sedgwick’s arrival at BU had been turbulent. A new right-wing president at BU had moved aggressively against more progressive faculty, leading to an unsuccessful faculty vote for his ouster and, in 1979, a faculty strike&lt;sup class='marginal-note'&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; that succeeded in unionizing the faculty. The success was brief, however. The union was decertified the following year when the National Labor Relations Board decided, farcically in the case of BU, that faculty at private universities were included in management. By 1981, tenure at BU had become a political decision, made by the BU president, and it was clear to Sedgwick from the onset that she would never be tenured there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Website/My%20Writings/BU%20Strike.pdf'&gt;www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Website/My Writings/BU Strike.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Sedgwick enjoyed her time at BU. Her department was congenial to her and she made good friends there, including Helen Vendler, a senior scholar and, at the time, recent president of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt;, who also became an important supporter and mentor for Sedgwick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at BU, Sedgwick published her second major critical article &amp;#8220;Homophobia, Misogyny, and Capital: The Example of &lt;cite&gt;Our Mutual Friend&lt;/cite&gt;.&amp;#8221; This article later became a chapter in Sedgwick’s book &lt;cite&gt;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&lt;/cite&gt;, much of which was drafted while Sedgwick was at BU. She also wrote poetry, especially continuing to work on &amp;#8220;The Warm Decembers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Boston Sedgwick joined with several other women, not all of whom were at BU, to form a George Eliot reading group, which rather quickly morphed into a feminist experimental writing collective. Needing a course number in order to have their writing xeroxed, they chose ID 450, which then became their name. ID 450 met regularly during the time that Sedgwick was in Boston, and has continued to meet, with a shifting membership, ever since. This group produced a number of life-long friendships for Sedgwick, including those with Carolyn Williams, Mary Campbell, Nancy Waring, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1983 Sedgwick moved across the Charles River, from Boston to Cambridge, to Radcliffe College’s Bunting Institute, where she had received a one-year faculty fellowship to complete her work on &lt;cite&gt;Between Men.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she was at the Bunting Institute, Sedgwick was offered a faculty position at Amherst College in Massachusetts. Nine years out of graduate school, with a substantial body of published poetry and critical writing, including one book published and another almost completed, Sedgwick was offered an associate professorship. Her tenuous and shifting footing in academia had become secure. She went to Amherst with tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Amherst: 1984 to 1988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After over 150 years as an all-male college, Amherst had become co-educational in 1976. An increased sensitivity to women’s issues contributed to Amherst taking the dramatic step in 1984 of banning fraternities on the campus, converting the on-campus fraternities into alternative forms of student housing. Additionally, the academic field of women’s and gender studies had been growing throughout the 1970s. Sedgwick was hired to bring an increased presence of gender studies to the English department, and hiring her with tenure gave her a secure position from which to encourage further change at Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This she did. For example, early in her tenure at Amherst, when invited to speak at a student convocation, she gave a satirical talk titled &amp;#8220;Sabrina doesn’t live here anymore&amp;#8221; (later published in the Amherst magazine) using the tribulations of the campus’s bronze statue of a naked woman of that name to discuss the conflicting pressures and expectations of being a woman at Amherst. Later, invited to address the seniors, arrayed in their gowns at a commencement gathering, she began by expressing her pleasure at seeing them all in their purple dresses and then went on to encourage them to pay close attention to how it felt to be dressed, and positioned as they then were. Institutionally, Sedgwick worked hard to gain greater academic respectability and support for studies of gender and sexuality. She was instrumental in the establishment, in 1987, of a department of women’s and gender studies, in which she then held a joint appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly regarded undergraduate liberal arts college, Amherst placed strong emphasis on teaching, and this was reflected in the interests and priorities of the English department. Preparing and teaching her courses placed heavy demands on Sedgwick’s time. Also, during her time there, the department offered a year-long introductory course in reading and writing, taught in small sections by all of the department faculty, but with a common syllabus. Discussing, revising, and reaching agreement on the contents of this syllabus was a major and time-consuming preoccupation of the department, which Sedgwick participated in energetically, successfully advocating, for example, for the first-time inclusion of the town’s local poet, Emily Dickinson, previously regarded as too minor to be included with the likes of Robert Frost, the town’s other local poet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick of course was not alone in working for change at Amherst. Her closest ally in this effort was Andrew Parker, who had helped to bring Sedgwick to Amherst.  Other faculty friends included Cindy Patton, Margaret Hunt, Judith Frank, and Rhonda Cobham-Sander. In addition to her friends at Amherst, Sedgwick also formed close friendships at some of the nearby colleges in the Pioneer Valley, including Mary Russo and Dan Warner at Hampshire College, and Maud Ellmann, who was visiting at Smith College and then at Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;The English Institute&lt;/span&gt; Founded around 1940 as a forum where new developments in criticism, theory, and scholarship could be presented and discussed, the English Institute in Sedgwick’s time held its annual meeting at Harvard.  As a graduate student and young faculty member Sedgwick invested this small meeting with great value, as a place where the most creative and brilliant thinkers were chosen to speak.  Thus the invitation to speak there was of great importance to her.  Later she went on to become one of the three trustees who ran the English Institute and were responsible for the choice of speakers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick’s arrival at Amherst nearly coincided with the publication of &lt;cite&gt;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&lt;/cite&gt; (1985). This publication sharply increased Sedgwick’s recognition within the academic community. She traveled frequently to other colleges, but now, rather than hunting for a job, she was being invited to share her latest work. By the time that &lt;cite&gt;Between Men&lt;/cite&gt; was published, Sedgwick had already begun writing the essays that would form her next book, &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/cite&gt;. In 1985, in what was for her a highly significant personal accomplishment, she was invited to speak at the English Institute. Her talk there&amp;#8212;one of the essays for her book-in-progress&amp;#8212;was &amp;#8220;The Beast in the closet: James and the writing of homosexual panic,&amp;#8221; which later received the Crompton Noll award in gay and lesbian criticism from the Modern Language Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her time at Amherst marked a personally painful shift in the balance between Sedgwick’s critical writing and her poetry. While continuing to be richly productive, and increasingly acclaimed, as a critic, she was blocked as a poet. &lt;cite&gt;The Warm Decembers&lt;/cite&gt; was a central project for her during her years at Amherst, but although she was deeply engaged in thinking about and sketching fragments of it, it proved, as she later wrote, &amp;#8220;unable to be written.&amp;#8221; In her note, in 1994, to the publication of the half-finished poem, she sees &amp;#8220;quite precisely the 1984 line&amp;#8230; [that]&amp;#8230; was the last one destined to have been written out of a relatively seamless sense of the integrity and momentum of this writing process. Yet it took me three or four more years of a punishing incredulity to understand that this poem was not being written. In fact it was nine years&amp;#8230; before I seemed to be able to write poetry of any kind.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Sedgwick enjoyed living in the Pioneer Valley and valued teaching at Amherst and helping to bring important change to the college, finding time for her writing was a continuing concern. In the spring of 1987, she was invited to spend the semester at the Berkeley campus of the University of California as the Mrs. William Beckman visiting professor. This position freed her from teaching but required several lectures, thus giving her both the time and incentive to work on two chapters for her book. For the following academic year, 1987-88, Sedgwick applied for and received a Guggenheim fellowship, which gave her the time she needed to complete much of the remaining work on &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; epidemic was already underway but only beginning to be widely recognized when Sedgwick came to Amherst. During her years there it became devastatingly central in the lives of those in and close to the gay community. Sedgwick’s concern with the epidemic, and with the virulent homophobia of most of the social and political responses to it, was deeply woven into her writing of &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology.&lt;/cite&gt; Her connection with the epidemic became much more personal near the beginning of 1987, when she met and ultimately formed very close friendships with two gay men living with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;. The first of these was Michael Lynch, whom Sedgwick first met at the annual meeting of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt; during the last week of 1986. Lynch was a gay activist, writer, poet, and teacher living in Toronto. Sedgwick celebrated her relationship with him during the last few years of his life in her talk &amp;#8220;White Glasses,&amp;#8221; later published as an essay in her book &lt;cite&gt;Tendencies.&lt;/cite&gt; Then, during her stay in Berkeley in the spring of 1987, Sedgwick met and became friends with Gary Fisher, a graduate student at UC and immensely talented young writer, who confided to Sedgwick (and few others) that he had &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year of her Guggenheim, Sedgwick continued to explore ways of more permanently increasing her time for writing. It was this, rather than a wish to leave Amherst, that made her tentatively receptive to a feeler from Stanley Fish, who was then engaged in transforming the English department at Duke University. Following negotiations and a visit to Durham, in North Carolina, Sedgwick was persuaded. She accepted an offer of a full professorship at Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Durham: 1988 to 1997&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;Chairs&lt;/span&gt; New appointments as distinguished professor were announced and celebrated annually at Duke, with recipients of chairs in all departments across the university gathering for a formal and festive ceremony.  The surprise of the occasion, for Sedgwick, was that her new chair proved to be not just a title but a physical chair &amp;#8211; handsome, broad, wooden, hard, and heavy.  After the dinner and speeches, the parking lot outside the Gothic revival building was filled with newly distinguished professors, in their evening dresses or tuxedos, struggling more or less unsuccessfully to load these ungainly chairs into their cars.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Sedgwick’s move to Duke contributed to the impression that its English department was becoming a center for new developments in literary criticism, it also enhanced her reputation as a rising academic star. This in turn perhaps heightened the attention that was paid to &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/cite&gt; when it appeared in 1990. Such attention was amply rewarded, and &lt;cite&gt;Epistemology&lt;/cite&gt; rapidly became a central text in the emerging field of gay studies. It was awarded second place (&amp;#8220;honorable mention&amp;#8221;) for the MLA’s 1990 prize for &amp;#8220;outstanding literary or linguistic study&amp;#8221; (first place went to Fredric Jameson, a senior colleague of Sedgwick’s at Duke, also recruited by Fish). In 1992 Sedgwick became a distinguished professor at Duke, receiving the Newman Ivy White Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attention paid to Sedgwick’s work was far from being entirely favorable. Her revelations through close and unconventional readings of sexual and homosexual themes and interests in the writings of respected and respectable authors were deeply troubling to many commentators. The fervor of disapprobation reached a crescendo when the advance program of the 1990 meeting of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MLA&lt;/span&gt; was published. A session titled &amp;#8220;The Muse of Masturbation&amp;#8221; and organized by Sedgwick and her colleague Michael Moon, included the title of her own paper: &amp;#8220;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl.&amp;#8221; To some pundits and many journalists, this was the clearest evidence yet of the impending collapse of western civilization. As one pundit wrote, Sedgwick was &amp;#8220;more dangerous than Saddam Hussein&amp;#8221; (who was the most popular villain in the national press at the time). This theme was picked up by one weekly news magazine and quickly echoed by the rest. Although Sedgwick had been courting attention to her ideas, she was disconcerted by its blatant superficiality. As she later pointed out, none of her critics could possibly have actually read her paper because it had not even been written at the time of the outcry about its title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to Duke, Sedgwick for the first time had the financial resources to buy a house, and she found one that suited her well. It was a 1960s spread out ranch-style house with many broad windows and several patios well-suited for Durham’s mild weather. A living room, dining area, kitchen, and casual room combined to form a long, largely open, central space that made for, as her real estate agent said, a great party house. Off of this central space were two separate wings with bedrooms and bathrooms, making it also a house in which people could live together and yet have their own separate spaces. The house was located near campus in what was called Duke Forest, a wooded area of houses developed by Duke for its faculty but by then no longer limited to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her first year at Duke, Sedgwick became close friends with Michael Moon, who had joined the English department a year earlier. Moon’s partner, Jonathan Goldberg, was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins and was living in Baltimore at that time, so they were also in a commuting relationship. At the end of the year Sedgwick invited Moon, who was living in a rented apartment, to live in her house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant difference between Amherst and Duke was the presence of graduate students. Although the Duke undergraduates, like those at Amherst, were good students, they were most often only taking a few English courses along their way to something else. The graduate students, by contrast, already had considerable experience in the study of literature and were mostly intent on it as a life-long pursuit. Sedgwick’s undergraduate teaching was limited to one course per year, but she taught a graduate seminar every semester. These seminars covered a wide range of topics, reflecting Sedgwick’s interests at the time. These topics included &amp;#8220;Queer Theory,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Experimental Critical Writing,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Victorian Textures,&amp;#8221; and a year-long independent study reading Proust’s &lt;cite&gt;A la recherche&lt;/cite&gt; (in translation). Through these seminars she came to know the graduate students and soon became good friends with many of them, inviting them to her home for meals or just to socialize. The most minimal list of these would have to include Amanda Berry, Renu Bora, Tyler Curtain, Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley, Adam Frank, Katie Kent, Jose Munoz, Brian Selsky, Melissa Solomon, and Sara Washburn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick also formed friendships with a number of the Duke faculty, including Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Cathy Davidson, Ken Wissoker (with whom Sedgwick, Moon, and Goldberg founded Series Q at the Duke Press), Laurie Shannon, and Elizabeth Clark (who had &amp;#8211; herself already a distinguished professor &amp;#8211; nominated Sedgwick for her distinguished professorship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many faculty, Sedgwick and Moon had studies at home and did most of their reading, writing, and lecture preparation there. With frequent visits from their colleagues and students, and occasional visits from Goldberg, Hal Sedgwick, and other friends from out of town, Sedgwick’s house evolved into just the kind of elastic, porous space of work and friendship that she so valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon was Sedgwick’s housemate for seven years. In 1995 Goldberg also accepted a professorship at Duke, and in the fall of that year he and Moon moved into a nearby house in Durham. Coincidentally, at the same time, Stephen Barber, who had recently completed his doctorate in English at the University of Toronto, came to Duke, drawn by Sedgwick’s presence there, on a post-doctoral fellowship. Sedgwick invited Barber to join her in her house, where he stayed for the two years of his fellowship. At that time, Sedgwick was deeply engaged in her work on affect, pedagogy, and performativity. Barber was accomplished in drag performance, so Sedgwick set out with his help to learn that art and to document the process of his teaching her. This project led to a number of well-received performances by the two of them and a few other friends at gatherings held at her house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick’s house was also a focal point for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; activism. Although the so-called &amp;#8220;research triangle&amp;#8221; formed by Durham, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh, was relatively liberal, North Carolina was a conservative state, and its senior senator then and for many years was the notoriously homophobic Jesse Helms. The local chapter of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt; UP (the direct action group formed to advocate for better treatment &amp;#8211; medical, social, and political &amp;#8211; for those who were &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;-positive or living with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;), which was called Triangle &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt; UP, organized frequent protests and demonstrations. Sedgwick and a number of her students were involved, sometimes meeting at her house to make plans and to create posters and t-shirts for their protests. Sedgwick’s writing about her participation in one of these protests was later included in her book &lt;cite&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;The Changing Situation at Duke&lt;/span&gt; Even before Sedgwick left Duke, the English department was changing in ways that made her more willing to go.  Fish’s buildup of the English department had created tensions.  As one long-time faculty member put it, before Fish arrived “we were a very standard, middle-of-the-road, probably conservative, traditional English department” [cf. note 2].  When Fish arrived and used good salaries and other perks to attract a critical mass of innovative, theoretically-oriented academic “stars,” it was natural for the earlier faculty to feel neglected and under-valued.  In 1992, Fish’s term as department chair ended, and under his successors these tensions began to surface, and the more traditional values of the department began to be reasserted in hiring, tenure and other decisions.  The intellectually exciting environment that Fish had been instrumental in creating at Duke began to erode, and the enthusiasm of the newer faculty for Duke began to fade.  By the end of the decade, almost all of them, including Fish, had either left or had distanced themselves from the English department.  Sedgwick, however, still believed in the value of what, for a few years, had been created at Duke.  As she said, “It was a wonderful thing to have happened” [cf. note 2].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 1991, Sedgwick was diagnosed with breast cancer. There followed major surgery and then six months of debilitating chemotherapy. This sudden encounter with mortality and medical practice was of course intensely disruptive in many ways. It also changed her perceived relation to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; and to her friends living with it, placing her with them on the same side of the divide between the healthy and those facing an early death. This change profoundly affected her thinking and writing. As she said in &amp;#8220;White Glasses&amp;#8221;: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;in many ways it is full of stimulation and interest, even, to be ill and writing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And write she did. In 1993 she published &lt;cite&gt;Tendencies&lt;/cite&gt;, her most intensely personal book thus far, whose essays helped to bring into being the field of queer theory. In 1994 she published her first book of poetry, &lt;cite&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/cite&gt;, bringing together some new poems with older poems that were either unpublished or published only in journals or magazines. In 1995, together with her graduate student, Adam Frank, she published &lt;cite&gt;Shame and its Sisters: A Silvan Tomkins Reader&lt;/cite&gt;. In 1996, she published &lt;cite&gt;Gary in Your Pocket&lt;/cite&gt;, a selection of Gary Fisher’s writing that she edited and introduced after his death from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; (Fisher had made her his literary executor). In 1997 she published &lt;cite&gt;Novel Gazing: Queer Readings in Fiction&lt;/cite&gt;, a collection of essays by Sedgwick and her students and colleagues.  And in 2000 she published &lt;cite&gt;A Dialogue on Love&lt;/cite&gt;, a blend of poetry and prose, in a seventeenth-century Japanese form known as haibun, drawing on the years of psychotherapy that she had entered into with Shannon Van Wey, following her breast cancer diagnosis. But although the events of &lt;cite&gt;A Dialogue on Love&lt;/cite&gt; took place in Durham, by the time it was published Sedgwick was no longer at Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Sedgwick left Duke, the English department was changing in ways that made her more willing to go. Fish’s buildup of the English department had created tensions. As one long-time faculty member put it, before Fish arrived &amp;#8220;we were a very standard, middle-of-the-road, probably conservative, traditional English department.&amp;#8221; When Fish arrived and used good salaries and other perks to attract a critical mass of innovative, theoretically-oriented academic &amp;#8220;stars,&amp;#8221; it was natural for the earlier faculty to feel neglected and under-valued. In 1992, Fish’s term as department chair ended, and under his successors these tensions began to surface, and the more traditional values of the department began to be reasserted in hiring, tenure and other decisions. The intellectually exciting environment that Fish and those he hired had been instrumental in creating at Duke began to erode, and the enthusiasm of the newer faculty for Duke began to fade. By the end of the decade, almost all of them, including Fish, had either left or had distanced themselves from the English department. Sedgwick, however, still believed in the value of what, for a few years, had been created at Duke. As she said &amp;quot;It was a wonderful thing to have happened&lt;sup class=&quot;marginal-note&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a href='http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9902/yaffe.html'&gt;http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9902/yaffe.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1996, Sedgwick began to suffer from pains in her neck and upper back. At the end of the summer, after some months of misdiagnosis, imaging revealed the source of the pain to be a recurrence of her breast cancer, which had spread to the bones in the upper part of her spinal column. To help stabilize her spine, Sedgwick was immediately put into a neck brace, which she then wore for many months. She also underwent an extended treatment of radiation therapy which successfully killed most of the cancer in her spine and allowed the bones to partially heal. But the metastasis of her original cancer to a distant part of her body meant that it was no longer curable and that, although treatment might succeed in slowing its progress, the cancer would eventually kill her. How long this might take was known to vary greatly across individuals, but Sedgwick was told that the odds were that she might live another two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick’s commuting relationship with Hal Sedgwick, taking turns flying back and forth between Durham and New York on weekends, was no longer sufficient. Also, although Duke had a good hospital, the range of care available in New York was greater. During the 1996-1997 academic year Sedgwick began to let some of her colleagues know that she would be interested in moving to New York City. One of those to whom she spoke was her friend Josh Wilner, who was on the faculty at the City University of New York (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;) and who then spoke about Sedgwick’s interest to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; administration. The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; PhD program in English responded enthusiastically. In the fall of 1997 Sedgwick taught a seminar there, continuing to commute from Durham, while discussions went on about a permanent move. By the end of the year it was agreed that she would leave Duke and join the faculty at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;. She sold her house in Durham, along with much of its furnishings, and rented a small studio apartment close to Hal Sedgwick’s equally small studio apartment in Greenwich Village. Just before January 1, 1998, she moved to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#container&quot; name=&quot;10&quot;&gt;New York City: 1998 to 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick’s move to New York made the news. &lt;cite&gt;The New York Times&lt;/cite&gt; ran a long article by Dinitia Smith, titled &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;Queer theory&amp;#8217; is entering the literary mainstream,&amp;#8221; which examined Sedgwick’s work in some detail. &lt;cite&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/cite&gt;, in an article with the heading &amp;#8220;Agit Profs&amp;#8221; and a photo of Sedgwick with Wayne Koestenbaum, who was also moving to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;, described their moves to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; as &amp;#8220;instantly elevating its gay-and-lesbian-studies faculty to one of the nation’s best.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick was happy with her move to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; has a number of large undergraduate campuses, spread throughout New York City, but its PhD programs are all brought together in its Graduate Center on Fifth Avenue. Although many of the faculty teaching at the Graduate Center have their primary affiliation with one of the undergraduate campuses, some, including Sedgwick and Koestenbaum, had their primary affiliation at the graduate center itself and taught only there. For Sedgwick, this meant that pretty much all of her students were working toward the PhD in English. She taught one graduate seminar each semester and devoted the remainder of her time to working with students individually and to her own work. This balance of activities suited her very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also liked the tone at the Graduate Center, which was friendly, collegial, and very supportive of its graduate students. Many of the graduate students were older than typical graduate students elsewhere, and often were carrying on other careers &amp;#8211; in teaching, journalism, the arts, and so forth &amp;#8211; at the same time that they were working toward their PhDs. Sedgwick’s seminars were enriched by their broader experience and maturity. A number of them became good friends. Among these were Allen Durgin, Billy Goldstein, Claudia Gonson, Greg Mercurio, Tina Meyerhof, and Keiko Miyajima. Although Sedgwick did her own work at home, she scrupulously kept her office hours at the Graduate Center, encouraging her students to just drop in and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of her time at Duke, two major new currents had arisen in Sedgwick’s life. One was a strong movement towards making arts and crafts. Although she had always pursued such activities, studying sculpture and etching at Cornell, for instance, and making most of her own clothes there and in graduate school, the resurgence of this interest was more intense. It took a variety of forms. Indeed, learning new techniques and experimenting with the effects of combining different techniques were central to her engagement with the arts. While still in Durham, Sedgwick extensively explored the creation of colored forms with polymer clays. At the same time, she took up weaving, starting with a table loom, but then investing in a full-size professional-quality floor loom. She acquired her new skills in a variety of way, through reading books and specialized magazines, through watching video instruction tapes, through experimentation, and though coursework (for example, she spent two weeks at the Penland School studying weaving with Liz Williamson, a distinguished Australian weaver and textile artist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other new current was a deep involvement with Buddhism. This arose from Sedgwick’s search for intellectual and emotional resources to help her deal with the new immediacy of her own mortality.  She pursued Buddhism both through her reading and by attending lectures and teachings. In May of 1997, for example, she spent three days at a Buddhist monastery in upstate New York attending a teaching by the Dalai Lama (on dependent origination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after her move to New York, Sedgwick made her first trip to East Asia. Her new interest in Buddhism was one of several influences that drew Sedgwick to Asia. A second influence was her brother David, who had been living in South Korea for many years, had married there, and now had a baby son &amp;#8211; a new nephew for her to visit. A third influence was an invitation to lecture in Taipei. In the fall of 1998, Sedgwick spent about a week in Seoul, visiting her brother and his family; followed by a week in Kyoto visiting the shrines, temple, and other cultural attractions there; and ending with a week lecturing and visiting with colleagues in Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick was deeply engaged by the arts and cultures that she found on this first trip to East Asia. Over the next several years this inspired additional trips, as many and as frequent as her resources of time, money, and energy would allow. Early in 1999 she spent about 1ten days in Kathmandu and several days in Bangkok. In the fall of 1999 she spent three weeks in China and Tibet. In 2000 she returned to Japan, lecturing in Tokyo and visiting feminist scholars in Kyoto. In 2001 she spent about two weeks in Turkey, visiting Hellenistic ruins along the coast and spending about a week in Istanbul. And in 2003 she spent about two weeks in Bali and several days in Hong Kong. This was the last of her trips to Asia. Although her interest remained strong, her physical condition made the long trip from New York increasingly difficult and also made the remoteness from her usual medical care increasingly problematic.  In later years, Sedgwick restricted her travels and lecturing to shorter and less demanding trips in the US and to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway into her second year in New York, Sedgwick left her rented apartment and moved into a larger studio apartment that she had purchased in Chelsea, still not far from Hal Sedgwick’s apartment, but also close to a pied-a-terre that Moon and Goldberg had in New York at that time. Less than two years later, she had the opportunity to buy the next-door studio apartment and, by combining the two apartments, was able to create a more extensive space in which to do her art work and store the materials for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s travels in Asia were a rich source of materials and ideas for her art. She acquired an extensive collection of fabrics, papers, yarns, and stamps (both rubber and wood-block) during her travels, as well as many photographs of the Buddhist sites she visited. In her work she transformed, manipulated, and assembled all these materials in many different ways. She was continually learning new techniques, sometimes self-taught but often augmented with courses of study at schools of arts and crafts around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999 Sedgwick had the first solo exhibit of her artwork, titled &amp;#8220;Floating Columns,&amp;#8221; at the Rhode Island School of Design. A selection from this exhibit was also shown the following year in a group show at the Cedar Creek Gallery in Durham. In 2001 she had another solo exhibition, titled &amp;#8220;In the Bardo,&amp;#8221; at the Stony Brook campus of the State University of New York. This exhibition was also presented at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; Graduate Center in the same year. A third solo exhibition, titled &amp;#8220;Bodhisattva Fractal World,&amp;#8221; was mounted in 2002 at the Johns Hopkins University and again in 2003 at Dartmouth College. Her fourth solo exhibition was at Harvard University in 2005. It was titled &amp;#8220;Works in Fiber, Paper, and Proust.&amp;#8221; Several of Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s art exhibits were accompanied by lectures indirectly related to the work being shown. In 2007 she presented a paper that was more directly about her artwork and was accompanied by many illustrations at Goldsmiths College of the University of London. Later the same year she presented a version of the same paper at the University of York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her art work, as well as her other new interests, influenced Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s choice of topics for her seminars at the Graduate Center. One of the seminars she created, and offered several times, was called (in homage to JL Austen) &amp;#8220;How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials.&amp;#8221; The topic was experimental artists&amp;#8217; books and mostly involved students in making their own, following a series of assignments that Sedgwick had designed. Sedgwick held these seminars at her studio, inviting the students to make free use of her collection of tools and materials. She also made her office at the Graduate Center into a mini studio, leaving the office unlocked so that students could made use of it at any time. Topics of Sedgwick’s other seminars at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; included &amp;#8220;Asian Encounters,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Zero, Infinity, Chaos, Sublimity&amp;#8221; (taught with Josh Wilner), &amp;#8220;Reading Relations,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Non-Oedipal Psychologies.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Victorian Textures&amp;#8221; (again), and several more iterations of her year-long seminar on Proust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick also continued to write, but now her writing was deeply infused with her new interests. This was evident in &lt;cite&gt;Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity&lt;/cite&gt;, which appeared in 2003, especially in the chapter “Pedagogy of Buddhism.” This was the last book that Sedgwick was to publish during her life. But in the years that followed she was hard at work, insofar as her health and energies allowed, on a series of essays, many of which were delivered as lectures, revolving around Proust’s &lt;cite&gt;A la recherche&lt;/cite&gt; but also encompassing the work of the philosopher JL Austin, the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, the poet CP Cavafy and others. Goldberg, who had agreed to be Sedgwick’s literary executor, has formed these essays into a book, currently in press, titled &lt;cite&gt;The Weather in Proust&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the time that the metastasis of her cancer was first diagnosed, Sedgwick continually received therapy for it. For several years after her move to New York, however, this therapy was fairly mild, consisting primarily of oral medications that she could take at home, although there were occasional serious problems with various side effects. During this period she often felt reasonably well and was able to carry on her work energetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As inevitably happens with metastatic cancer, however, this therapy eventually stopped working. Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s care then followed the pattern, common with such cancer, of moving from one therapy to another, staying with each one as long as it worked, or as long as its side effects were tolerable, but with each successive therapy working for a shorter time, if it worked at all. This was a period of ups and downs &amp;#8211; times when Sedgwick was able to carry on fairly well and times when her illness was nearly debilitating. During this period Sedgwick continued to teach, to make art, to write, and to travel, giving lectures around the US and in Europe. Her illness increasingly drained her mental and physical energies, however, gradually forcing her to limit her activities to the most essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the summer of 2008 Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s illness worsened again, eventually making her cancel or postpone all of her travel plans. A promised essay that she finished in November was the last writing project that she completed, although she continued to make plans for further projects. In the 2008–2009 academic year, she again gave her Proust seminar. She continued to attend and participate in these seminars, although increasingly relying on her graduate students to help lead them. In February of 2009, the cancer in her spine, no longer controlled by her therapy, began to press on her spinal cord, progressively weakening her legs over several weeks until she was confined to a wheelchair. For several weeks in March, no longer able to travel to the Graduate Center, Sedgwick held her Proust seminar, with beer and pizza, in her studio. Throughout this period Sedgwick continued to believe in the possibility that a new therapy might stabilize or even improve her condition, and she continued to make plans for such a future. By the end of March, however, Sedgwick’s physicians had concluded, as they then explained to her, that further therapy would not be helpful and that she did not have long to live. On April 10 she entered the hospice program at Beth Israel Medical Center in lower Manhattan. She died there just before midnight on Sunday, April 12, 2009.&lt;sup class=&quot;marginal-note&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='marginal'&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class='heading'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;A longer narrative concerning Eve&amp;#8217;s cancer may be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://evekosofskysedgwick.net/biography/cancer2.html&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Hal Sedgwick was Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s primary caregiver during her illness, many students, friends, and family also gave her tremendous help and support. Following her death, Josh Wilner took over her Proust seminar for the remainder of the semester. Jon Goldberg, as noted above, has edited her writings from the last decade of her life into a book. Work on her archives and on many other projects, as described elsewhere in this website, continues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Touching Feeling</title>
    <link href="/writing/touching-feeling.html"/>
    <updated>2011-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/writing/touching-feeling</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A pioneer in queer theory and literary studies, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick brings together for the first time in &lt;em&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/em&gt; her most powerful explorations of emotion and expression. In essays that show how her groundbreaking work in queer theory has developed into a deep interest in affect, Sedgwick offers what she calls &amp;#8220;tools and techniques for nondualistic thought,&amp;#8221; in the process touching and transforming such theoretical discourses as psychoanalysis, speech-act theory, Western Buddhism, and the Foucauldian &amp;#8220;hermeneutics of suspicion.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In prose sometimes somber, often high-spirited, and always accessible and moving, &lt;em&gt;Touching Feeling&lt;/em&gt; interrogates &amp;#8212; through virtuoso readings of works by Henry James, JL Austin, Judith Butler, the psychologist Silvan Tomkins, and others &amp;#8212; emotion in many forms. What links the work of teaching to the experience of illness? How can shame become an engine for queer politics, performance, and pleasure? Is sexuality more like an affect or a drive? Is paranoia the only realistic epistemology for modern intellectuals? Ultimately, Sedgwick’s unfashionable commitment to the truth of happiness propels a book as open-hearted as it is intellectually daring. –&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[Sedgwick’s] ideas about the structures of desire between men in fiction have generated critical work for others, as her theories are put to work in re-readings of authors, texts, genres and periods. Any critic who so successfully challenges the fundamental terms of the discipline, and opens up new subjects for others to write and publish about, deserves fame and distinction. Moreover, Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s courage in speaking openly about her illness and about aspects of her self that most academic women would keep private, including being fat, is very moving.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Elaine Showalter, London Review of Books&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eve Sedgwick is one of the most amazing scholars of our time. Her erudition, brilliance, passion, and unusual combination of interests thrill. Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s latest book, &lt;em&gt;Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity,&lt;/em&gt; excites, demands, perplexes &amp;#8230; Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s book is a marvelous read. Literary scholars and professors of education, put your seatbelts on, for Sedgwick certainly takes you on an interesting ride. She once again makes a significant contribution to not just one but many intersecting fields&amp;#8212;literary criticism, education, queer theory, cultural studies, and autobiography. If scholars are not yet in love with Eve, they will be after reading this book.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Marla Morris, Journal of the History of Sexuality&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[Sedgwick’s] miraculous prose keeps ideas and attitudes in play that would collapse into contradiction or program in a lesser writer&amp;#8230; In the era of queer theory, Sedgwick’s miraculating writing keeps open a sense of sexuality as not binarized, neither only instrumental nor irreducibly conflictual, even when she is most passionately engaged in the work of advocacy. Today, writing through and after &amp;#8216;queer&amp;#8217; in a landscape of political impoverishment, Sedgwick’s thought and writing function, as she would say, as a kind of semaphore: There is More Than This. I think we need her writing more than ever.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Christopher Nealon, American Literature&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These collected essays brush, with a graceful, soulful touch, across such topics as how illness (her own cancer) shapes her teaching, or shame provokes queer empowerment, or paranoia (her own fears) fires up intellectual daring. Sedgwick, a queer-identified straight academic, is a challenging, truly original thinker. Her muse – borne by electric, almost erotic language – is too stimulating to shun merely because it&amp;#8217;s not simple.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Richard Labonte, Q Syndicate Book Marks&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Fearless, challenging and occasionally exhilarating, Sedgwick remains one of the most courageous critics around.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sedgwick’s remarkable power to define the field of gender and sexuality studies over the past couple of decades can be traced to a number of causes: her undeniable brilliance; her apparently infinite will to read – and especially to read against the grain of a deadening common sense; her generosity, to which nearly all who write about her attest. But her influence is certainly also traceable to her wonderful talent for performing linguistic acts of definition.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Heather Love, Women’s Review of Books&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Of the many insights and fronts for action suggested by this book, the one I will take most to heart is a continuing belief in possibility. This is especially necessary when in more cynical moments a favored interpretation seems automatic or even mandatory. Sedgwick has tried to provide the conditions for a mind &amp;#8216;receptive to thoughts, able to nurture and connect them, and susceptible to happiness in their entertainment.&amp;#8217; It sounds such a modest hope, yet her writing shows it to be one consistently beset with difficulties, adding to our estimation of Sedgwick’s courage in these conservative times.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Melissa Gregg, The Electronic Book Review&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <updated>2011-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/writing/the-coherence_of_gothic_conventions</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Containing revised opening and closing chapters, this new edition of &lt;em&gt;The Coherence of Gothic Conventions&lt;/em&gt; makes the case that the Gothic in English literature has been marked by a distinctive and highly influential set of ambitions about relations of meaning. Through readings of classic Gothic authors as well as of De Quincey and the Brontes, Sedgwick links the most characteristic thematic content of the Gothic firmly and usably to the genre’s radical claims for representation. A new introduction to this reprint of a 1980 study clarifies the connection between the linguistic or epistemological argument of the Gothic and its epochal crystallization of modern gender and modern homophobia. &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Tendencies</title>
    <link href="/writing/tendencies.html"/>
    <updated>2011-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/writing/tendencies</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; brings together for the first time the essays that have made Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick &amp;#8220;the soft-spoken queen of gay studies&amp;#8221; (Rolling Stone). Combining poetry, wit, polemic, and dazzling scholarship with memorial and autobiography, these essays have set new standards of passion and truthfulness for current theoretical writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essays range from Diderot, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James to queer kids and twelve-step programs; from &amp;#8220;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&amp;#8221; to a performance piece on Divine written with Michael Moon; from political correctness and the poetics of spanking to the experience of breast cancer in a world ravaged and reshaped by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;. What unites Tendencies is a vision of a new queer politics and thought that, however demanding and dangerous, can also be intent, inclusive, writerly, physical, and sometimes giddily fun. &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sedgwick is one of the smartest and wittiest critics writing. The play of her mind as it goes from Henry James to John Waters and Divine, from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; to Jane Austen and women’s anal eroticism, is dazzling. Her work is often as moving as it is acute: Like the best of the gay male writers whose work has been her principal subject, in her prose flawless surface lures the reader to explore new depths.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Marilyn Hacker, The Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is deservedly recognized as the primum mobile of lesbian and gay studies. Yet her real achievement lies not so much in the creation of a new academic discipline, as in the profound implications her work carries for the rest of the academy, and the wider world beyond. &lt;em&gt;Tendencies&lt;/em&gt; provides a marvelously exhilarating excursion across the range of her interests and involvements &amp;#8230; She is the most consistently intelligent, courageous, perceptive, daring, and sensible critic currently writing in the United States. I strongly recommend panic-buying.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Simon Watney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;From the most celebrated and the most prolix practitioner of lesbian and gay theory comes a collection of critical essays augmented by a memorial to a friend dead of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; at 39; an ingratiatingly playful &amp;#8216;performance piece&amp;#8217; about drag, co-written with Michael Moon; and other occasional pieces. The most difficult but the most rewarding essays are those on Henry James and Oscar Wilde. The latter in particular &amp;#8212; a close reading of &lt;em&gt;The Importance of Being Earnest&lt;/em&gt; that becomes a meditation on the &amp;#8216;avuncular,&amp;#8217; itself a revision of the heterosexist and hermetic Oedipal model &amp;#8212; exemplifies Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s ability to liberate homoerotic texts from the punitively &amp;#8216;normalizing&amp;#8217; paradigms of hegemonic discourses. &lt;em&gt;Tendencies,&lt;/em&gt; one of the first books issued under the imprint of Duke University Press&amp;#8217; Series Q, is erudite, witty, and essential.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Weiss, Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is best known as a cultural and literary critic, as one of the primary forces behind the development of queer and gay/lesbian studies, and as author of several influential books: &lt;em&gt;Tendencies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&lt;/em&gt;. The publication of &lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt;, Sedgwick’s first volume of poetry, opens up another dimension of her continuing project of crossing and re-crossing the electrified boundaries between theory, lyric, and narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embodying a decades-long adventure, the poems collected here offer the most accessible and definitive formulations to appear anywhere in Sedgwick’s writing on some characteristic subjects and some new ones: passionate attachments within and across genders; queer childhoods of many kinds; the performativity of a long, unconventional marriage; depressiveness, hilarity, and bliss; grave illness; despised and magnetic bodies and bodily parts. In two long fictional poems, a rich narrative momentum engages readers in the mysterious places – including Victorian novels – where characters, sexualities, and fates are unmade and made. Sedgwick’s poetry opens an unfamiliar, intimate, daring space that steadily refigures not only what a critic may be, but what a poem can do. –&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt; is a wrenchingly honest account – or enactment – of a writer’s relation to her gift &amp;#8230; filled with hesitations, self-cancellations, erasures, and gratifying fireworks. The pleasure of &lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt; is witnessing Sedgwick discovering, again and again, the wonders – gorgeous shames and vindications – of what she can say.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How often the fiercest, the most autonomous American critics have been poets; from Emerson to Blackmur, from Burke to Hartman, many a discursion could be illustrated, even illuminated by reading the ulterior verse. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is such another, and it will enrich certain enigmas she has proposed, as well as appeal to certain appetites she has awakened, to immerse in this element – fragmentary at its widest reach (a deconstructed Victorian 3-decker), healing at its most abrupt (&amp;#8216;the yard, the mud, the morning / in their new, punished clothes&amp;#8217;), and ever searching for the makings of the dilemma. Such is the true poetics of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and of course it is the poetry as well.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Richard Howard&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Reading &lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling experience. The publication of these poems will help to complete our picture of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick who, already recognized as one of the most extraordinary critics of her generation, now proves herself one of its truly innovative poets.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Maud Ellmann&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is poetry of a great soul which presents to mind shapely and unmistakable presences brought very close to the eye. &lt;em&gt;Fat Art, Thin Art&lt;/em&gt; is a work of poetic distinction and indispensable human use.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Allen Grossman&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Epistemology of the Closet</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is at stake in male homo/heterosexual definition? At a time when the politics of homosexuality are more contested with every day’s news, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues that the vexed imperatives to specify straight and gay identities have become central to every important form of knowledge of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounded in gay theory and politics and offering new paradigms for them, Sedgwick’s book explores the consequences for our culture of an epochal shift in turn-of-the-century Euro-American discourse: the moment when each person, in addition to having a gender based on a male/female dichotomy, also came to have a sexuality based on the particular dichotomy homo/hetero. Through readings of Melville, Nietzsche, Wilde, James, and Proust, Sedgwick shows how questions of sexual definition are at the heart of every form of representation in this century. She makes the case that, to the degree that work in any modern discipline of thought fails to perform a specifically antihomophobic analysis, the work will be flawed not contingently but centrally. And she offers an ambitious range of examples and techniques for pursuing the antihomophobic project in newly imaginative, assertive, and trenchant ways throughout contemporary culture. –&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Epistemology&lt;/em&gt; is a profound study on how we live our life in culture, and how our actions, identities, and ethics are symptomatic effects of various networks of power at work in society.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;The Feminist Review&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since the late 1980s, queer studies and theory have become vital to the intellectual life of the U.S. This has been, to no small degree, due to the popularity of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s critically acclaimed Epistemology of the Closet. Working from classic texts of European and American writers &amp;#8212; including Herman Melville, Henry James, Marcel Proust, and Oscar Wilde &amp;#8212; Sedgwick delineates a historical moment in which sexual identity became as important a demarcation of personhood as gender had been for centuries. Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s literary analysis, while provocative and often startling (you will never read &lt;em&gt;Billy Budd&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt; the same way again), is simply the basis for a larger project of examining and analyzing how the categories of &amp;#8216;homosexual&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;heterosexual&amp;#8217; continue to shape almost all aspects of contemporary thought. &lt;em&gt;Epistemology of the Closet&lt;/em&gt; is a sometimes-dense work, but one filled with wit and empathy. Sedgwick writes with great intelligence and an eye for irony, but always makes clear that her theories and critical acumen are in the service of a politic that seeks to make the world a better and more humane place for everyone. An extraordinary book that reshapes how we think about literature, sexuality, and everyday life.&amp;#8221;  –&lt;cite&gt;Michael Bronski&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A signal event in the history of late twentieth-century gay studies. Sedgwick dispenses paradigms with breathtaking fluency, untangles every knot in gay theory, and proves that modern cognition itself hinges on the hetero/homo impasse. A virtuoso reader of novels and of predicaments, she illustrates what literary and cultural criticism, at its best, can be. I batten on every sentence. I don’t feel so remunerated, so challenged, so moved, by anything else I’ve read in the field.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This book gives us what the debate on &amp;#8216;outing&amp;#8217; has lacked: a theory of the closet. By showing us that the closet is no place, but a structural relation – in our culture, the primary structural relation of knowledge/ignorance – Sedgwick has sharpened the edge of Foucault’s work on sexuality and power. In so doing, she has produced an essential antihomophobic text, the one every straight person had better read.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Douglas Crimp&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A Dialogue on Love</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When she begins therapy for depression after breast cancer treatment, the author brings with her an extraordinarily open and critical mind, but also shyness about revealing herself. Resisting easy responses to issues of dependence, desire, and mortality, she warily commits to a male therapist who shares little of her cultural and intellectual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not without pain, their improvised relationship is as unexpectedly pleasurable as her writing is unconventional: Sedgwick combines dialogue, verse, and even her therapist&amp;#8217;s notes to explore her interior life – and delivers and delicate and tender account of how we arrive at love. –&lt;cite&gt;From the jacket copy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s brilliant &lt;em&gt;A Dialogue on Love&lt;/em&gt; is more than a compelling testament to the extraordinary powers of language to make sense of illness: It is a lyrically honest meditation on pleasures given and received at some of life’s most paradoxically difficult moments. Her writing here arises as if from her very soul, and the discovery she charts of her own emotional inner self is as astonishing as it is beautiful. Loving and wise teacher, groundbreaking and controversial scholar, scared but resilient breast cancer survivor, utterly fabulous queer icon, skilled weaver of gorgeous fabrics, shy daughter of middle-class Jews – Eve Sedgwick is all of these, but most importantly, as she proves herself in this great gift of a book, she is truly a poet of incomparable courage, insight, and power.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;Rafael Campo&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sedgwick reports that since her cancer diagnosis she’s become more obsessed with crafts and weaving – the concrete joys of &amp;#8216;making stuff&amp;#8217; offering relief from more troublingly abstract concerns. This book, densely colorful but deliciously extracurricular in tone and form, partakes of a similar aesthetic. Sedgwick, whose academic work has been attacked for its obscurity, has rarely written this accessibly. It’s disarming to learn that this radical critic refers to her husband of 25 years as her &amp;#8216;fella,&amp;#8217; and there’s equal enjoyment in seeing this fiercely analytic theorist of homosexual identity as she uses her gaydar to suss out [her therapist&amp;#8217;s] tastes at first glance.&amp;#8221; –&lt;cite&gt;David Kurnick, The Village Voice&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Zero Infinity</title>
    <link href="/teaching/zero-infinity.html"/>
    <updated>2011-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/teaching/zero-infinity</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h5&gt;Zero, Infinity, Chaos, Sublimity&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course examines how science and literature deal with the limits of representation. The emergent field of chaos theory investigates the interrelationship between chaotic behavior and systematic organization. While the disciplinary context for much of this recent work has been the physical sciences and mathematics, many of the problems and concepts with which chaos theorists work, including iterability, recursive systems, scaling, period doubling, interference and incommensurability can be related more or less directly to concerns that have preoccupied literary theorists and semioticians  in thinking about representational systems. Nor is this field of investigation without a significant history: in the West, the aesthetic notion of the sublime, which goes back at least to Longinus, has been the focus of a long and rich meditation on the relationship of language and representation to that which disrupts and limits it, and the legacy of what has been called the &amp;#8220;Romantic sublime&amp;#8221; continues to exert a powerful influence on our present literary culture.  In Asian thought, meanwhile, both Taoist and Buddhist traditions have explored implications of chaos, infinity, and nothingness.  Assuming that students of literature, scientists and mathematicians may have something to learn from talking to and reading one another, this seminar proposes to investigate some of the possible  connections: between current work in chaos theory and literary theory, and between both of these and some traditions of the sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will read contemporary writers on chaos theory such as Gleick, Peats and Briggs, as well as lay writings on number theory (focusing particular on the notions of zero, infinity, and the infinitesimal) by Seife, Rotman, and most importantly, Wittgenstein. Writings in literary theory will include Neil Hertz (on Longinus and the sublime) and Paul de Man (on Pascal and the zero). We will use Chuang-tzu and Alan Watts as windows into Taoist and Buddhist traditions.  Western literary texts that will be central to our discussion will include Pope (from The Dunciad), Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, A. R. Ammons,  and some contemporary science fiction.   (N.B. No special knowledge of mathematics will be needed; &amp;#8220;math-phobia&amp;#8221; should present no obstacle to participation in discussion, and may indeed become a topic for investigation.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Rhetorical Devices</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h5&gt;Rhetorical Devices&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no particular reason why most of you need an encyclopedic knowledge of classical rhetorical figures, though they&amp;#8217;re fun. But some of them have gotten picked up for use in recent theories of representation; especially structuralist and deconstructive, and to some extent psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial. Jonathan Culler&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Structuralist Poetics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;On Deconstruction&lt;/em&gt; are good introductions to the first two of these areas. A good online introduction to classical rhetoric – along with an amazingly extensive list of definitions – is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tropes that have turned up in literary theory, with definitions and thoughts on where and how they&amp;#8217;ve proved theoretically interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;allegory&lt;/em&gt;: Gr. &amp;#8220;speaking otherwise.&amp;#8221; A sustained system or network of figuration continued throughout a work, producing separate and more or less self-consistent levels of meaning. (Examples: &lt;em&gt;The Faerie Queene&lt;/em&gt;; Bunyan&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim&amp;#8217;s Progress&lt;/em&gt;.) The relation between the levels may be arbitrary, as in Proust when the church statues of the Virtues and Vices depict &amp;#8220;vulgar and energetic&amp;#8221; women who just happen to be bearing a basket (Charity), a snake (Envy), etc., rather than themselves looking charitable or envious. In the post-Romantic tradition allegory has been compared, to its disadvantage, with symbolism, which was seen as based on similarity, hence less arbitrary and artificial. But Paul de Man put these valuations back in play in &amp;#8220;The Rhetoric of Temporality&amp;#8221; (collected in &lt;em&gt;Blindness and Insight&lt;/em&gt;), arguing for the interest of allegorical figures on just this basis. In his 1986 essay &amp;#8220;Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,&amp;#8221; Fredric Jameson theorized that all &amp;#8220;third world&amp;#8221; literatures are necessarily allegories of nation-formation, which makes them uninteresting to the First World readers who prefer literary renderings of the private as opposed to the public experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;anacoluthon&lt;/em&gt;: a-na-co-LU-thon. Gr. &amp;#8220;lacking sequence.&amp;#8221; A grammatical interruption or lack of implied sequence within a sentence. That is, beginning a sentence in a way that implies a certain logical resolution, but concluding it differently than the grammar leads one to expect – an interruption or a verbal lack of symmetry. It especially involves uses and violations of parallel-structure expectations. This term hasn&amp;#8217;t been used theoretically as far as I know, but seems to have potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;chiasmus&lt;/em&gt;: ki-AZ-mus. Gr. &amp;#8220;a placing crosswise, a diagonal arrangement.&amp;#8221; Repetition of ideas or grammatical structures in inverted order (AB-BA). &amp;#8220;It is boring to eat; to sleep is fulfilling&amp;#8221;;  &amp;#8220;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask rather what you can do for your country.&amp;#8221; Like anacoluthon, it generally presumes a context of parallel structure. Because of its criss-cross relation to temporality, a looser, narrative notion of chiasmus is often associated with the psychoanalytic notion of &lt;em&gt;Nachtraglichkeit&lt;/em&gt; or deferred action (what Silvan Tomkins calls posticipation), in which experiences, impressions, and memory-traces may be revised at a later date to fit in with fresh experiences or with the attainment of a new stage of development (Laplanche and Pontalis, &lt;em&gt;The Language of Psycho-Analysis&lt;/em&gt;, 111). In the Introduction to &lt;em&gt;Between Men&lt;/em&gt; (13-15), I discuss a congruence between ideology (drawing on Marx and Juliet Mitchell) and sexuality, based on a shared chiasmic narrative structure, in which &amp;#8220;the subject of the beginning of the narrative is different from the subject at the end, and &amp;#8230; the two subjects cross each other in a rhetorical figure that conceals their discontinuity.&amp;#8221;  These senses of chiasmus also have an affinity with &lt;em&gt;différance&lt;/em&gt;, a word coined by Derrida (in &lt;em&gt;Writing and Difference&lt;/em&gt;) to link together the features of &lt;em&gt;deferral&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; in the structure of language (i.e. the ways that meanings are not self-present in words, but depend on both a system of diacritical differences across the language as a whole, and also on the temporal displacements involved in iterative utterance and grammatical contextualization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;metaphor&lt;/em&gt;: Gr. &amp;#8220;carrying beyond.&amp;#8221; An implicit comparison made by referring to one thing as another on the basis of similarity. Sometimes contrasted with &lt;em&gt;simile&lt;/em&gt;, which makes the same kind of comparison explicitly using words &amp;#8220;like&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;as.&amp;#8221; But since 1956, when the structuralist linguist Roman Jakobson published &lt;em&gt;Two Types of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances&lt;/em&gt;, it has been more common to contrast metaphor with &lt;em&gt;metonymy&lt;/em&gt; (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;metonymy&lt;/em&gt;: me-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TON&lt;/span&gt;-a-me. Gr. &amp;#8220;change of name.&amp;#8221; Referring to one thing by means of another that is not linked to it by similarity (as in metaphor), but instead by spatial proximity or some other contingent relation. Thus, to narrate an announcement by the President, you could say &amp;#8220;The White House announced&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; (a metonymy) or &amp;#8220;The smirking chimp announced&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; (a metaphor). Based on Jakobson&amp;#8217;s work, there was a lot of interest in classifying &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of representation (or even association) in terms of metaphoric vs. metonymic, and an increased interest in metonymy. For example, de Man&amp;#8217;s treatment of allegory vs. symbolism (see above) is derived by extension from the comparison of metonymy vs. metaphor. In psychoanalysis, the symbolizing function of &lt;em&gt;condensation&lt;/em&gt; became associated with metaphor, and &lt;em&gt;displacement&lt;/em&gt; with metonymy. (See Laplanche and Pontalis on these terms; Lacan depends on this association in asserting that the unconscious is &amp;#8220;structured like a language.&amp;#8221;)  Because metonymic slippage is based on contiguity rather than similarity/identity, some postmodern approaches value it because it does not privilege a single center, being more weblike in structure (to use George Eliot&amp;#8217;s image) or, in Deleuze&amp;#8217;s term, rhizomatic (like a plant that propagates by sending down roots in multiple places). In French feminism, metonymy has been seen for similar reasons (decenteredness, slipperiness) as a characteristic of &lt;em&gt;l&amp;#8217;écriture féminine&lt;/em&gt; (feminine writing), as variously conceived by Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mise en abyme&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MEEZ&lt;/span&gt;-on-a-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BEEM&lt;/span&gt;. Fr. &amp;#8220;putting-in-the-abyss&amp;#8221; (not classical – coined by André Gide in 1926). A concentric or recursive structure, like the Cracker Jack box with a picture of a sailor holding a Cracker Jack box with a picture of a sailor holding a Cracker Jack box etc., or like a novel within a novel within a novel etc. Postmodern fiction is fond of this structure, though it goes back at least as far as &lt;em&gt;The 1001 Nights&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;prosopopoeia&lt;/cite&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PRO&lt;/span&gt;-so-po-&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PAY&lt;/span&gt;-a. Gr. &amp;#8220;giving a face; making a person.&amp;#8221; In classical rhetoric this refers either to personification (speaking of an abstraction or object as if it were a person: &amp;#8220;Fear convinced me to flee&amp;#8221;) or, alternatively, impersonation (an imitation of a person, comparable to the modern dramatic monologue). Paul de Man and J. Hillis Miller describe prosopopoeia as a kind of primordial figure of figures: prosopopoeia gives face to that which has no face, thereby creating a world within which, once it&amp;#8217;s in place, one can distinguish the literal from the figural. De Man associates this figure with personal identity: &amp;#8220;Prosopopeia is the trope of autobiography, by which one&amp;#8217;s name [&amp;#8230;] is made as intelligible and memorable as a face. Our topic deals with the giving and taking away of faces, with face and deface, figure, figuration and disfiguration&amp;#8221; (&lt;cite&gt;Rhetoric of Romanticism&lt;/cite&gt;, p.76). In her &lt;cite&gt;Decomposing figures: Rhetorical Readings on the Romantic Traditions&lt;/cite&gt;, Cynthia Chase especially attends to prosopopoeia as a trope of absence and mourning, as when it features on gravestones or invokes the voice of the dead. Judith Butler implicitly invokes such arguments in her discussion of gender identity as a form or effect of melancholia (&lt;cite&gt;Gender Trouble&lt;/cite&gt;). A good queer-theory use of the concept is in Jonathan Flatley&amp;#8217;s essay, &amp;#8220;Warhol Gives Good Face,&amp;#8221; in the collection &lt;cite&gt;Pop Out: Queer Warhol&lt;/cite&gt; (ed. Flatley et al).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h5&gt;Reading Relations in British Fiction&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar will practise close reading of a sample of British fiction in pursuit of &amp;#8216;reading relations&amp;#8217; in several senses, through several intertwined questions.  What have been the implications of focusing realistic fiction so sharply on the desiring intensities of the bourgeois family?  How have the familial &amp;#8216;relations&amp;#8217; of realistic fiction been both read by psychoanalytic thought and replicated within it?  How do literacy and reading function as topic and as hermeneutic within these fictions? What forms of relationality get constructed in them – not only among characters, but between the novels themselves and those who read them? How do these reflect or affect the self-relationality of narrators and/or of authors?  We will look for alternatives to normative understandings of sexual, familial, narrative, and self-relationality in a small group of works by Thackeray, Dickens, Charlotte Bronte, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Penelope Fitzgerald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required Readings:  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All auditors and enrolled students are required to (1) keep up with the reading on a weekly basis, and (2) speak in class at least once every week.  Enrolled students are required to complete a mutually-agreed-on final project, and to consult with me substantively, early, and often about its nature and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending consultation, I am very open to collaborative and/or experimental projects, as well as more conventionally presented ones.  First-year students who obtain my approval early in the semester also have the option of keeping a reading journal (&amp;gt;5 pages per week) instead of undertaking a final project.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How To Do Things With Words And Other Materials</title>
    <link href="/teaching/how-to-do-things-with-words-and-other-materials.html"/>
    <updated>2011-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h5&gt;How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary Syllabus: How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials is an experimental seminar/studio workshop in which participants will think about and practice a variety of ways of combining written text with other visual media.  Roughly speaking, the &amp;#8217;artist&amp;#8217;s book&amp;#8217; will be our subject, but we will also consider comics and graphic novels, mail art, graffiti, broadsides, playing cards, and other genres that make unconventional use of the materiality of both the written word and its support.  In parallel with historical and theoretical discussions, participants will work on creating a portfolio of works in various formats and materials, each exploring different aspects of the complex relations among language, materiality, and visuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes: (1) This is not a class in fine printing or bookbinding.  (2) While students are free to use digital techniques, the class will not broach the area of electronic media.  (3) Participants must be interested in doing art as well as looking at and thinking about it, but need not be experienced in the use of materials.  This is a good class for novices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text:&lt;br /&gt;
The required text is Keith Smith&amp;#8217;s Structure of the Visual Book, Expanded 4th Edition (2003).  Some selections from Johanna Drucker&amp;#8217;s The Century of Artists&amp;#8217; Books (1994, 2004) will be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Trips:&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m currently working to set up three field trips for us: 1) to the incredibly full artists books collection at the New York Public Library; 2) to the Fales Library Downtown Collection at &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;, which documents the downtown arts scene of the 1970s-1990s, birthplace of artist books as they&amp;#8217;re currently thought of; 3) to Printed Matter, a bookstore in Chelsea, founded in 1976 with a mission to foster the appreciation, dissemination, and understanding of artists&amp;#8217; publications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h5&gt;Asian Encounters&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar concerns the relation of Asian religious thought – especially Buddhism – to European and American culture. Brahmanism and Buddhism have &amp;#8216;arrived&amp;#8217; and been influential in western thought in many forms through many different encounters over many centuries.  Thus, by now an Asian encounter with western culture must also be understood as a re-encounter with a palimpsest of previous Asian currents and influences (as well as vice versa).  Necessarily, then, the seminar also involves a range of difficult methodological, theoretical, and political issues surrounding authenticity, dissemination, appropriation, and perhaps especially, pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All auditors and enrolled students are required to   &lt;br /&gt;
(1) keep up with the reading on a weekly basis, and   &lt;br /&gt;
(2) speak in class at least once every week.    &lt;br /&gt;
Enrolled students are required to complete a mutually-agreed-on writing project.  Depending on where you are in your graduate work and what you want to use this class for, you have a variety of options for this project.  One possibility would be a reading journal, with weekly entries of  &amp;gt;5 pages recording your reflections on the current assignment, perhaps in relation to your other ongoing reading projects.  Or you might choose to write a full-dress (20-25 pp.) paper, which could be structured either around one or more of the texts studied, or around an encounter between another literary text and some of the material from this seminar.  Another possibility would be individual/small group research on some other aspect of Asian-western encounters.&lt;br /&gt;
I expect you to consult with me substantively, early, and often about the nature and progress of your writing project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart Sutra of the Prajna Paramita  &lt;br /&gt;
(from the Sanskrit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara practiced the Profound Perfection of Transcendent wisdom, he saw that the Five Aggregates* were empty, thus completely relieving misfortune and pain.  &lt;br /&gt;
Sariputra, form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form.  Form is exactly emptiness, emptiness exactly form.  Feeling, perception, intention, and consciousness are also like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sariputra, all things, having the nature of emptiness, have no beginning and no ending; they are not defiled or pure, increased or decreased. Thus, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no intention, no consciousness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. Therefore, there is no sight, sound, odor, taste, object, and knowledge. There is nothing from the visual world to the conscious world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, and so on up to no aging and death, and also no extinction of aging and death. There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no suppression of suffering, no path to annihilation of suffering. There is no path, no wisdom, and no gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No gain and thus the Bodhisattvas realize the Profound Perfection of Transcendent Wisdom, and so their minds are unhindered.  No hindrance, therefore no fear.  Far beyond deluded thoughts, this is Nirvana. All the Buddhas of the past, present, and future have fully awakened into unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment  by realizing the Profound Perfection of Transcendent Wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the Profound Perfection of Transcendent Wisdom is known as the great mantra, the vivid mantra, the best mantra, the unsurpassable mantra.  It completely clears all pain. This is the truth and not a lie. So set forth the mantra of the Profound Perfection of Transcendent Wisdom, set forth this mantra and say:  &lt;br /&gt;
ga-te ga-te para-gate para-samgate bodhi &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVAHA&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the Heart Sutra of the Prajna Paramita&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The aggregates of which a human body is composed: form, feeling, conception, impulse, and consciousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heart Sutra  &lt;br /&gt;
(from the Tibetan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha at Vulture Peak mountain, together with a great gathering of the sangha of monks and a great gathering of the sangha of bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered the samadhi that expresses the dharma called &amp;#8220;profound illumination,&amp;#8221; and at the same time noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, while practicing the profound prajnaparamita, saw in this way: he saw the five skandhas to be empty of nature.  &lt;br /&gt;
Then, through the power of the Buddha, venerable Shariputra said to noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, &amp;#8220;How should a son or daughter of noble family train, who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressed in this way, noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, said to venerable Shariputra, &amp;quot;O Shariputra, a son or daughter of noble family who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita should see in this way: seeing the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are emptiness. Thus, Shariputra, all dharmas are emptiness. There are no characteristics. There is no birth and no cessation. There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no dharmas, no eye dhatu up to no mind dhatu, no dhatu of dharmas, no mind consciousness dhatu; no ignorance, no end of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no origin of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment. Therefore, Shariputra, since the bodhisattvas have no attainment, they abide by means of prajnaparamita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is no obscuration of mind, there is no fear. They transcend falsity and attain complete nirvana. All the buddhas of the three times, by means of prajnaparamita, fully awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment. Therefore, the great mantra of prajnaparamita, the mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the unequaled mantra, the mantra that calms all suffering, should be known as truth, since there is no deception. The prajnaparamita mantra is said in this way:  &lt;br /&gt;
OM &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PARAGATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PARASAMGATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;BODHI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SVAHA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Shariputra, the bodhisattva mahasattva should train in the profound prajnaparamita.  &lt;br /&gt;
Then the Blessed One arose from that samadhi and praised noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, saying, &amp;#8220;Good, good, O son of noble family; thus it is, O son of noble family, thus it is. One should practice the profound prajnaparamita just as you have taught and all the tathagatas will rejoice.&amp;#8221;   &lt;br /&gt;
When the Blessed One had said this, venerable Shariputra and noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, that whole assembly and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Author and scholar Eve Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist. In this lecture, scholar Jason Edwards examined a broad range of Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s art works, as the culminating presentation in a series of seminars on Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is best known as the author of a series of quickly paradigmatic texts on queer and affect theory, including Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire, Epistemology of the Closet, Tendencies, and Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity. Much less appreciated is the fact that Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist, whose works were shown in exhibitions including Floating Columns/In the Bardo, Bodhisattva Fractal World and Works in Fiber, Paper and Proust. Jason Edwards (Reader in Art History at the University of York and author of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Alfred Gilbert&amp;#8217;s Aestheticism: Gilbert Amongst Whistler, Wilde, Leighton, Pater, and Burne-Jones) contextualized her artwork in relation to her better-known literary theoretical and other works on paper.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>February 25-26, 2010: Spanking and Poetry conference, CUNY</title>
    <link href="/blog/spanking-and-poetry-conference-cuny.html"/>
    <updated>2010-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://bryanreedy.org/blog/spanking-and-poetry-conference-cuny</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;call for proposals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I was a child the two most rhythmic things that happened to me were spanking and poetry.&amp;#8221; (&lt;i&gt;Tendencies&lt;/i&gt; 182)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve Sedgwick lovingly, if none too gently, slapped open the sphincter-tight boundary rings of critical scholarship on the sexual and affective relations between bodies. This conference invites continued play with the tools she created for examination of &amp;#8220;all the different surfaces that make a self for most of us, printed pages, &amp;#8216;our&amp;#8217; ideas, institutional relations and activism, vibrations of a voice, the gaping abstractions and distractions of creativity, the weird holographic projections of our names and public personae, the visible and impressible extent of the parts of our bodies&amp;#8221; (&lt;i&gt;Tendencies 104-05&lt;/i&gt;). We welcome paper proposals on any aspect or application of her critical, literary, and artistic work, inviting scholars to broadly consider and reconsider Sedgwick&amp;#8217;s intersections with and influences upon their fields. In the spirit of her own perversion of academic style, we particularly encourage proposals that expand the boundaries of the conventional conference paper through experimental or creative critical practices. We also seek papers engaging with Sedgwick’s pedagogical practices and proposals, as expressed in her written work or as performed in her classes at The Graduate Center or other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanking and Poetry conference was nearly canceled due to an unexpected snowstorm that shut down much of the city&amp;#8212;including the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; Graduate Center, where the conference was to be held. Many incoming flights were delayed or canceled, and keynote speakers Jonathan Goldberg and Michael Moon were unable to get to the city. Thanks to the efforts of the conference’s organizers, Tracy Riley and Margaret Galvan, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CUNY&lt;/span&gt; agreed to open its doors for an informal plenary session. Around fifty people made their way through the snowy streets to attend a lively and moving series of panels. Attendee and presenter Mia Chen wrote an in-depth review of the conference &lt;a href=&quot;http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/sequined-beings-are-we/#more-127&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, before Eve was so ill, I asked her if there was some kind of memorial that she might like.  She told me that she liked the idea of a bench in a pretty spot, where friends could sit and enjoy the view.  Recently I made a donation to Madison Square Park, which is at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street and is the prettiest little park that I know of here in the city.  In return, they have now put up a plaque for Eve on a bench that I selected there.  Many years ago Eve had told me a quote from Chaucer that she would like to use as an epitaph, and it is on the plaque. &amp;#8212; &lt;cite&gt;Hal&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Text taken from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/calendar/event.php?id=92477&amp;amp;cid=73&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;Honoring Eve website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day of rich intellectual exchange in honor of the memory of Professor Sedgwick, the &amp;#8220;soft-spoken queen of gay studies,&amp;#8221; the &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;primum mobile&amp;#8217; of queer theory,&amp;#8221; and one of the most gifted writers of our time.  Eve taught at Boston University in the early 1980s and there are still many there who remember her from those years.  BU hosted many of her old friends and newer fans for a day of remembrance and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ID 450 Collective, whose name and genesis was inspired by Eve, began as a study group on published feminist thinking, but when we started writing ourselves-also instigated by Eve-we broadened the subject considerably with our own disparate imaginations and experiences, a project that was simultaneously happening within the feminist movement in the 1980s. But while feminist activists were fighting about differences among us, we were having a lot of fun exploring those differences. When Eve was with us from 1982-84 (plus a bit in 1986-87, 1991, and once in 2008), we staged an all-night meeting discussing our first sexual experience with a human at a Howard Johnson’s motel room in the Fenway; we ordered ID 450 T-shirts and then jackets with &amp;#8220;feminist&amp;#8221; names such as &amp;#8220;Tang&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Dreamwhip&amp;#8221;; we published some of our writings in a lesbian sex magazine called &lt;i&gt;Bad Attitude,&lt;/i&gt; which no one mentioned on her vita; we discussed ways to escape binary thinking on Eve&amp;#8217;s lawn in Amherst (at Eve’s instigation, of course); we cooked and ate sumptuous meals together. After Eve left the group, we wrote autobiographical fragments about our lives for 6 or 7 years, a rich herstorical record of our shared yet different lived experiences as women. When Eve left this world in April, we wrote memorials to her together and formally sent prayers to her in the Bardo, wishing her no pain, and a safe journey to wherever she is resting and playing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos from the symposium are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/honoringeve/&quot; class=&quot;newwindow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; Proceedings from the symposium will be published in a forthcoming issue of &lt;i&gt;Criticism: Quarterly for the Literary Arts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
