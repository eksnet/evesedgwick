    <h5>How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials</h5>
<p>Preliminary Syllabus: How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials</p>
<p>How to Do Things with Words and Other Materials is an experimental seminar/studio workshop in which participants will think about and practice a variety of ways of combining written text with other visual media.  Roughly speaking, the &#8217;artist&#8217;s book&#8217; will be our subject, but we will also consider comics and graphic novels, mail art, graffiti, broadsides, playing cards, and other genres that make unconventional use of the materiality of both the written word and its support.  In parallel with historical and theoretical discussions, participants will work on creating a portfolio of works in various formats and materials, each exploring different aspects of the complex relations among language, materiality, and visuality.</p>
<p>Some notes: (1) This is not a class in fine printing or bookbinding.  (2) While students are free to use digital techniques, the class will not broach the area of electronic media.  (3) Participants must be interested in doing art as well as looking at and thinking about it, but need not be experienced in the use of materials.  This is a good class for novices.</p>
<p>Text:<br />
The required text is Keith Smith&#8217;s Structure of the Visual Book, Expanded 4th Edition (2003).  Some selections from Johanna Drucker&#8217;s The Century of Artists&#8217; Books (1994, 2004) will be distributed.</p>
<p>Field Trips:<br />
I&#8217;m currently working to set up three field trips for us: 1) to the incredibly full artists books collection at the New York Public Library; 2) to the Fales Library Downtown Collection at <span class="caps">NYU</span>, which documents the downtown arts scene of the 1970s-1990s, birthplace of artist books as they&#8217;re currently thought of; 3) to Printed Matter, a bookstore in Chelsea, founded in 1976 with a mission to foster the appreciation, dissemination, and understanding of artists&#8217; publications.</p>
