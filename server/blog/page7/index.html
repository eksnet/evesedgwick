            <p>Jason Edwards, who is currently working on a book focused on Eve’s textile art, led an intimate series of seminars in Eve’s studio and at the Graduate Center. In-depth discussions focused on Eve’s work in “fiber, paper, and Proust” as well as her bookworks, weavings, and panda calendars. The series of seminars culminated in an opportunity for former students to bring and discuss their own work produced in Eve’s book arts classes.</p>

            <div class='marginal post-meta'>
              <!--SUNDAY, FEB 28, 2010-->
              FEBRUARY 28, 2010

            <p>From the <a href="http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/" class="newwindow">call for proposals</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a child the two most rhythmic things that happened to me were spanking and poetry.&#8221; (<i>Tendencies</i> 182)</p>
<p>Eve Sedgwick lovingly, if none too gently, slapped open the sphincter-tight boundary rings of critical scholarship on the sexual and affective relations between bodies. This conference invites continued play with the tools she created for examination of &#8220;all the different surfaces that make a self for most of us, printed pages, &#8216;our&#8217; ideas, institutional relations and activism, vibrations of a voice, the gaping abstractions and distractions of creativity, the weird holographic projections of our names and public personae, the visible and impressible extent of the parts of our bodies&#8221; (<i>Tendencies 104-05</i>). We welcome paper proposals on any aspect or application of her critical, literary, and artistic work, inviting scholars to broadly consider and reconsider Sedgwick&#8217;s intersections with and influences upon their fields. In the spirit of her own perversion of academic style, we particularly encourage proposals that expand the boundaries of the conventional conference paper through experimental or creative critical practices. We also seek papers engaging with Sedgwick’s pedagogical practices and proposals, as expressed in her written work or as performed in her classes at The Graduate Center or other institutions.</p>
<p>The Spanking and Poetry conference was nearly canceled due to an unexpected snowstorm that shut down much of the city&#8212;including the <span class="caps">CUNY</span> Graduate Center, where the conference was to be held. Many incoming flights were delayed or canceled, and keynote speakers Jonathan Goldberg and Michael Moon were unable to get to the city. Thanks to the efforts of the conference’s organizers, Tracy Riley and Margaret Galvan, <span class="caps">CUNY</span> agreed to open its doors for an informal plenary session. Around fifty people made their way through the snowy streets to attend a lively and moving series of panels. Attendee and presenter Mia Chen wrote an in-depth review of the conference <a href="http://sedgwickconference.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/sequined-beings-are-we/#more-127" class="newwindow">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Some time ago, before Eve was so ill, I asked her if there was some kind of memorial that she might like.  She told me that she liked the idea of a bench in a pretty spot, where friends could sit and enjoy the view.  Recently I made a donation to Madison Square Park, which is at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street and is the prettiest little park that I know of here in the city.  In return, they have now put up a plaque for Eve on a bench that I selected there.  Many years ago Eve had told me a quote from Chaucer that she would like to use as an epitaph, and it is on the plaque. &#8212; <cite>Hal</cite></p>
