The one resident female on campus for most of the college’s history, Sabrina had long been the subject of pranks and ill treatment. In contrast to Sabrina’s mute suffering, Sedgwick advises, “women, feel anger. Think about what to do with anger…. <i>Write it</i>…[and] women, learn how to weep without stopping talking.” </h5>

Jacob Hale's "Leatherdyke Boys and Their Daddies - How to Have Sex Without Women or Men," published in the same special issue of <i>Social Text</i>. Sedgwick writes that Hale's paper begins "the project of articulating subjectivities that purposefully move across the boundaries of gender." </h5>

However, in this review Sedgwick finds that if it is “as bold and daring as claimed," <i>The L Word</i>'s "novelty does not lie in either a demographic coup or a startling use of the medium.”  Rather, Sedgwick praises the program for less radical virtues, and anticipates that its audience will consist of women and men, gay and not, “who enjoy smart and well-made domestic drama, psychological and relationship-based, low on violence, criminality, and sensation.” </h5>

She notes that “sometimes I feel like my students' analyst; other times, floundering all too visibly in my helplessness to evoke language from my seminar, I feel like a patient being held out on by 20 psychoanalysts at once.” </h5>

Sedgwick observes that this claim coexists with anti-gay regulation of speech such as <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i> and broader regulation of speech in <i>FCC v. Pacifica</i>. She argues that "it is speech and visibility that give us any political power we have." </h5>

                     <h5 style='font-weight:normal; font-size:15px; line-height:20px;'> Sedgwick traces particular difficulties in attempting the task of the essay's title. For example, she demonstrates the impossibility of learning about Oscar Wilde’s homosexuality from the circa 1960s <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> if one doesn’t already know. She takes this as an emblem of “the extremely elusive and maddeningly plural ways in which cultures and their various institutions efface and alter sexual meaning.” She goes on to say that “at least for Western society of the last two millennia, the many complicated paths by which...sexual meaning is falsified, denied, and altered, all lead homosexuals to much the same thorny and difficult place.” </h5>
