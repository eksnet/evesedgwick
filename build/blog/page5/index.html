            <p>Students of Eve Sedgwick’s at the <span class="caps">CUNY</span> Graduate Center have formed a group, chartered by the Doctoral Students&#8217; Council, to practice some of the book-arts presented in Sedgwick&#8217;s unique course, &#8220;<a href="http://evekosofskysedgwick.net/teaching/how-to-do-things-with-words-and-other-materials.html" class="newwindow">How To Do Things With Words and Other Materials</a>&#8221;. The Text Textile Texture Studio (or 3Text Studio), as the group is called, takes its inspiration from the original classes, as well as the exhibition that was part of the 2010 <a href="http://evekosofskysedgwick.net/blog/spanking-and-poetry-conference-cuny.html" class="newwindow">Spanking and Poetry</a> conference. 3Text Studio has held events for making accordion books, hexaflexagon books, articulated dolls, and other activities. Studio events are open to members and friends of the Graduate Center community as well as graduate students from other institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eve was incredibly generous &#8212; setting up her office as a fully-stocked studio for students in the department to use. When that closed, many of us wanted not only to continue doing the work ourselves, but to help other people discover how satisfying and inspiring it can be,” said Annie Cranstoun, co-chair of 3Text.  You can see some of the work that has emerged from the Studio on their <a href="http://3textstudio.wordpress.com" class="newwindow">website</a>.</p>

            <p>The Boston University Gender + Sexuality Studies Group has announced that Janet Halley, Harvard Law School’s Royall Professor of Law, will give the annual Sedgwick Memorial Lecture: “When Feminism Rules: Assessing Governance Feminism Projects from the International to the Local.” (Click on the image for further information.) Halley’s most recent book is <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8258.html" class="newwindow"><i>Split Decisions: How and Why to Take a Break from Feminism.</i></a> Lauren Berlant wrote: “This is a wide-ranging, vastly original, knowing, and challenging book; there is nothing like it in any of the antinormative challenges of the last two decades.” We are very much looking forward to Halley&#8217;s lecture.</p>

The review appeared in <i>Seventeen’s</i> “Curl up and read” column.  Eve’s friend Josh Wilner remarks, “What I enjoy most is the way Eve figures out exactly what the features of a chatty sophisticated literary-review for <i>Seventeen</i> are &#8211; and nails it.”  This is the first publication of Eve’s that we know of. If anyone knows of anything earlier, <a href="http://evekosofskysedgwick.net/about/about.html" class="newwindow">we’d love to hear about it</a> .</p>

            <p>After three years working with Hal Sedgwick developing this website and cataloguing Eve&#8217;s archive, I am sad to announce I have moved on to other projects. In January, I began managing Ugly Duckling Presse, a nonprofit poetry and art publisher in Brooklyn, and I will also have a book of my own coming out from St. Martin&#8217;s Press in Spring of 2013. It has been an absolute honor to work with Eve&#8217;s writing and art, and the experience and proximity to her work has colored my life in a thousand unexpected and often magical ways. I am so grateful for the opportunities that Hal (and Eve&#8217;s many extraordinary, brilliant, and unfailingly kind friends) have brought into my life. The archive will continue in great hands, and I&#8217;m so excited to see what the future brings.<br />

            <p>The Center for the Humanities at The Graduate Center, <span class="caps">CUNY</span>, is hosting a monthly spring reading group (February 14-May 15) focused on the first section of Eve Sedgwick&#8217;s book <em>The Weather in Proust</em>. The first section, approximately three-quarters of the book, comprises Sedgwick&#8217;s work on and around Proust. Sedgwick&#8217;s rich and complex view of Proust emerges as she approaches his writing through discussions of topics such as Neoplatonism, Buddhism, Theory of Mind, autism, the poet C P Cavafy, Melanie Klein, and Sedgwick&#8217;s own artwork, to name a few. The group will be led by H A Sedgwick and Joshua Wilner, and facilitated by a series of volunteers. Attendance at all five meetings is highly desirable, and participants will be asked to take an active part in the discussion. Enrollment is limited, so please register as soon as possible.</p>
