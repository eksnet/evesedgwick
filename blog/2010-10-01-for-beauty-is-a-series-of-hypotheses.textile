h5. October 1, 2010: For Beauty is a Series of Hypotheses

Author and scholar Eve Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist. In this lecture, scholar Jason Edwards examined a broad range of Sedgwick's art works, as the culminating presentation in a series of seminars on Sedgwick's art. 

To date, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is best known as the author of a series of quickly paradigmatic texts on queer and affect theory, including Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire, Epistemology of the Closet, Tendencies, and Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity. Much less appreciated is the fact that Sedgwick was also a devoted and passionate fiber artist, whose works were shown in exhibitions including Floating Columns/In the Bardo, Bodhisattva Fractal World and Works in Fiber, Paper and Proust. Jason Edwards (Reader in Art History at the University of York and author of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Alfred Gilbert's Aestheticism: Gilbert Amongst Whistler, Wilde, Leighton, Pater, and Burne-Jones) contextualized her artwork in relation to her better-known literary theoretical and other works on paper.
